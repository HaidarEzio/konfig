![Konfig Flow](/img/konfig-flow.png)

**Konfig is a developer tool for creating SDKs for APIs so onboarding is seamless for
developers.** We do this by automating the process of converting your OpenAPI
Specification or Postman Collection into high quality SDKs in the most popular
languages. Today our [CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/konfig-cli) can get you
started in minutes and handle any level of customization that you need through
simple configuration. Read the [Getting
Started](/docs/getting-started/openapi-specification) guide to try it yourself.

## Quick Demonstration
