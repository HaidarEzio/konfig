# Customize your SDKs

## Why customize your SDK?

Generating your SDK allows you to avoid writing a lot of the tedious boilerplate
that a developer would otherwise need to write like configuring authentication,
creating HTTP requests, or serializing/deserializing responses. But sometimes
its necessary to customize the output of the SDK generation so you can implement
custom business logic into your SDKs. Common use-cases are:

1. Implementing language-specific paradigms such as JavaScript's async iterators or Python's context manager
2. Parameters or Responses that can't be described as part of your OpenAPI
   Specification such as OS-level primitives like file pointers or custom classes
3. Streaming responses
4. Request signing
5. Custom documentation snippets
6. Custom flows (pagination or combining operations)
7. Custom functions

## How to customize your SDK

Konfig allows you to override or customize any part of a generated SDK by doing any of the following:

1. Create a `.konfigignore` file at the top-level of the generated SDK. The
   syntax for `.konfigignore` is the same as `.gitignore` and tells the generator
   to not override or delete these files when re-generating your SDK. This means
   you can add new files or modify generated files to fit your exact requirements.
   Adding particular files to `.konfigignore` is how pagination is implemented in SDKs.

     Using `.konfigignore` covers all customization use-cases as it allows you
     to modify anything about the generated SDK.

2. Implement request lifecycle hooks. For example here is a Python SDK with a
   custom lifecycle hook for request signing:
   https://github.com/passiv/snaptrade-sdks/blob/master/sdks/python/snaptrade_client/request_after_hook.py).
   This is helpful when you need to modify the contents of every request without
   customizing core files in the generated SDK.
3. Every generator config allows you to override documentation snippets. For
   example here is a Python SDK that contains a custom "getting started" snippet in
   the top-level `README.md` file using the `readmeSnippet` /
   `apiDocumentationAuthenticationPartial` fields
   https://github.com/passiv/snaptrade-sdks/tree/master/sdks/python. This is
   helpful when you have a default workflow that all your API users need to follow
   and don't want to override the entire `README.md` as some parts of the
   `README.md` are auto-generated.
4. Konfig supports customizations out of the box such as `topLevelOperations`
   which places an operation on the top-level client for convenience or
   `clientState` which allows you to add more state to the client to be used in
   custom files or request lifecycle hooks.
