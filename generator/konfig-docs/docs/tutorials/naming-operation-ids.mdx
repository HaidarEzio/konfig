# Naming your Operation IDs for better SDK Method Names

## Definitions

### What is an Operation ID?

Every [Operation Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#operation-object) has
an optional field called `operationId` that is globally unique. This field is
required to create SDKs with pleasing method names. The OpenAPI Specification
does not require these IDs by default but Konfig's linter will recommend that
you fill them out.

### What is a Tag?

A "Tag" which is specified globally in the [Tag Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#tag-object) and locally in the [Operation Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#operation-object) is used for logical grouping of operations. Konfig uses the Tag to namespace method names.

## How to name your Operation ID

The best way to name your operation ID:

1. Prefix your operation IDs with the Tag that is specified in the Operation
   Object and an underscore character `_` (i.e. `Dog_` or `Authentication_`).
   Konfig will remove the prefix from the operation id and use the suffix for the
   generated method name. This allows us to make operation ID globally unique while
   sharing generated method names.

   <Admonition type="note">
     It is not strictly enforced that you use your tags in your prefix but just
     make sure your operation IDs are globally unique.
   </Admonition>

2. Use camel case (i.e. `create` or `createUser`). Camel case is succint and
   since we are already using `_` it would be visually confusing to use snake case.

### Example

```yaml
paths:
  /v1/pets/dog: # notice how the path is not used to generate method names
    post:
      tags:
        - Dog # tag is used to determine namespace of method name
      operationId: Pet_create # does not use the "Dog" tag prefix but still works
  /v1/pets/cat:
    post:
      tags:
        - Cat
      operationId: Cat_create
```

This will generate pleasing SDK class and method names in TypeScript:

```typescript
await dog.create();
await cat.create();
```

Both method names are succinct yet not conflicting with each other because they are under different namespaces.
