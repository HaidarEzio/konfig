### Recap

In this tutorial, we learned about the benefits of SDKs, generated an SDK from
scratch, and refactored an implementation using the generated SDK ðŸŽ‰.

### Further Reading

When doing this on a real API you will need to make modifications to your
OpenAPI Specification to generate high-quality SDKs. Konfig also makes this easy
through its <a target="_blank" href="/docs/tutorials/setup-linting">lint</a> and
<a target="_blank" href="/docs/tutorials/fix-openapi-spec">fix</a> utilities. You also want to setup
Continuous Deployment through <a target="_blank" href="/docs/tutorials/automate-sdk-updates#github-action">GitHub
Action</a> or
<a target="_blank" href="/docs/tutorials/automate-sdk-updates#polling">polling</a>. And sometimes it's also
necessary to add business logic in the SDKs which is also made easy by Konfig
through our <a target="_blank" href="/docs/custom-sdks">support for customization</a>.
