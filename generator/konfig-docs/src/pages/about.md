# About

Konfig is a developer tools company; we build API tooling based off the [OpenAPI
Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/) and [Postman Collection Format](https://schema.postman.com/collection/json/v2.1.0/draft-07/collection.json) standards.

## The Problem

Onboarding customers for API-first companies is difficult because APIs are
complicated and time-consuming to integrate.

## The Solution

We generate SDKs for APIs so developers can integrate any API while writing as
few lines of code as possible.

## The Team

We are a passionate team of 3 people.
