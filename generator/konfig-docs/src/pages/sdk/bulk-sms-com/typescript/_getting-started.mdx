     * The API uses HTTP Basic Auth for authentication.
     * 
     * You are requested to preemptively provide the `Authorization` header in your requests and not wait until the server has provided a `401 Unauthorized` response.
     * 
     * Doing so will reduce the number of requests required to achieve your goal, which will improve overall performance.
     * 
     * You authenticate using either the username you supplied when you registered with [BulkSMS](https://www.bulksms.com) or with an _API Token_. API tokens can be created by logging into your account and visiting _Settings &gt; Developer Settings &gt; API Tokens_.
     * 
     * __Important:__
     * - Where possible, use an API Token instead of the username and password when writing software against the API.
     * 
     * Whether you use a username or an API Token, the values must be [Base64 encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) before using it in the header.
     * For example, if the username is `Aladdin` and the password is `OpenSesame`, the unencoded header value is `Aladdin:OpenSesame`.  After encoding, the full header becomes
     * 
     * ```
     * Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpPcGVuU2VzYW1l
     * ```
     * When using an API token, the value to be encoded will be `<token-id>:<token-secret>`.  These values _before Base64 encoding_ look something like this
     * 
     * `
