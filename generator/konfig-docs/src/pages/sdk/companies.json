You can invest significant resources into building carrier and order source integrations. And, after those integrations are built, you can continue exhausting resources to maintain them. Many businesses choose this expensive, time-intensive path — only to realize the approach is unsustainable.\n\nThere's a better alternative: Integrate once with ShipEngine and never worry about building or maintaining integrations again. Spend your team's valuable time and money on projects that are core to growing your business, rather than dealing with legacy carrier integrations. In addition to the ROI you achieve after implementing ShipEngine, our shipping API also offers pre-negotiated, discounted rates through the USPS, UPS and DHL. Our users report that shipping-related tasks that once took minutes now take seconds, and that ShipEngine's features and capabilities help unlock thousands in savings.\n\nGetting started with ShipEngine is easy.\n\nVisit our API documentation and start building with our SDKs at shipengine.com/docs/\n\nSchedule time to talk to one of our shipping experts by visiting shipengine.com/contact/\n\nOr get a free API key and start building, no credit card required, at shipengine.com/signup/",

    "metaDescription": "At Unstructured, we're on a mission to give organizations access to all of their data. We know the world runs on documents—from research reports and memos, to quarterly filings and plans of action, documents are the unit of information that companies depend on. And yet, 80% of this information is trapped in inaccessible formats, and businesses have long struggled to unlock this data, leading to information silos, inefficient decision-making, and repetitive work. Until now.\n\nUnstructured captures this unstructured data wherever it lives and transforms it into AI-friendly JSON files for companies who are eager to fold AI into their business.",
