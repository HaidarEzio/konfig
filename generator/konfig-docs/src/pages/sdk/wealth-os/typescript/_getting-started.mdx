```typescript index.ts
import { WealthOs } from 'wealth-os-typescript-sdk';

const wealthOs = new WealthOs({
    // GUI/Publisable key of the Wealth Manager. Needed when GUI needs to communicate directly with WealthOS API in certain scenarios. This key has limited permissions & life span and can only access few defined APIs. Usually this is sent as part of the response from another REST API
    apiPubKey: "AUTHORIZATION",
    // Secret key for the Wealth Manager BE, needed to communicate with WealthOS REST API. This Key must be a secret and must be securely held and ONLY be used by Wealth Manager BE system.
    apiSecretKey: "X_API_KEY",
    // Secret key for the Wealth Manager BE, used for WebSocket API. This is the same secret key of REST API, but sent as a query paramater for web socket connections
    wsSecretKey: "X_TOKEN"
})
