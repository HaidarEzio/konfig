     * ## Authentication
     * 
     * Deel API uses API tokens to authenticate requests. A bearer token is required to authenticate all API requests.
     * 
     * All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.
     * 
     * ```
     * curl -X GET 'api.letsdeel.com/rest/v2/contracts' \
     * -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR-TOKEN-HERE'
     * ```
     * 
     * ### Generating Access Tokens
     * 1. Navigate to **Apps & Perks > Developer Center**.
     * 2. Click on the “Generate New Token” button.
     * 3. In the popup, click “Generate Token” button to generate a new token. Your newly generated token is visible on the screen.
     * 4. Make sure to copy and save your token once is generated. You won't be able to see it again!
