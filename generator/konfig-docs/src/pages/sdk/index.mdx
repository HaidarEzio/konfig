## Introducing SDKs-as-a-service for developers

Konfig SDKs is a one-of-a-kind service for developers that want to write and
maintain less API integration code. We do this by giving you SDKs for APIs to
save time and effort when writing and maintaining your API integrations.

## Why?

APIs are a pain to integrate with. They are complex, and they are a pain to
maintain. Typically you will need to write and maintain your own SDKs, but this
is a time-consuming process. Furthermore, documentation can widely vary in
quality and consistency. We make sure that you don't have to deal with this.

Konfig provide a consistent and well-documented SDK for every API that you use so
that your codebase has less code and updates are easier to handle.

## How does it work?

1. Konfig maintains an [open and MIT licensed repository](https://github.com/konfig-sdks/openapi-examples) of OpenAPI specifications for public APIs.
2. We generate [ergonomic SDKs](https://github.com/orgs/konfig-sdks/repositories) for every API in TypeScript, Python, Java, C#, PHP, Ruby, Go, Swift, and Dart
3. We distribute access to these SDKs for a monthly subscription
4. We notify you when an API you are using is updated
