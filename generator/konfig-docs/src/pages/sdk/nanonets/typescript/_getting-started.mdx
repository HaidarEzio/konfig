     * When you sign up for an account, you are given your first API key. To do so please [follow this link.](https://app.nanonets.com/#keys)
     * 
     * Also you can generate additional API keys, and delete API keys (as you may need to rotate your keys in the future). NanoNets expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:
     * 
     * <span style="color:red">Authorization: REPLACE_API_KEY</span>
     * 
     * All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.
