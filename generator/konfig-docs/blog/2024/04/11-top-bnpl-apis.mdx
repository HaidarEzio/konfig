# The 10 Best Buy Now Pay Later APIs in 2024

Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) seemed to explode out of nowhere during COVID, as consumers flushed with cash and with nothing to do made a lot of big ticket purchases online. In the years since, BNPL continued to grow at a healthy clip and is projected to power almost $100 billion of transactions in the US in 2025. If you want to incorporate BNPL into your product, you can easily do it via API!

## What are BNPL APIs?

BNPL allows consumers to pay for their online and in-store purchases in installments. The typical terms are 4 installments charged bi-weekly. So if you purchase a $2,000 laptop, instead of paying $2,000 upfront with cash or a credit card, you can split the purchase into 4 bi-weekly, automated payments of $500 each. A BNPL API allows you to connect your e-commerce app or website to other parts of the payment ecosystem (issuers, processors, networks, etc) and set up and maintain buy now pay later installment plans using the network.

## Why are BNPL APIs useful?

BNPL APIs are useful because they are another option to allow consumers to fund purchases of big ticket items if they don’t have the money to pay for them right now. BNPL can be a better way for customers to pay versus credit cards because certain BNPL plans are interest-free. The downside versus credit cards is that using a BNPL plan means you don’t build your credit score, you don’t get points or other perks, and you have to pay back the purchase in a shorter time period than a credit card if you don’t want to pay interest.

## The Best BNPL APIs of 2024

### [Afterpay](https://www.afterpay.com/en-US)

![Plaid](./assets/plaid.webp)

Plaid is the largest universal financial services integration API and provides a wide coverage of institutions from brokers, retirement plan providers, crypto exchanges and more and investment account types. One potential downside of using Plaid is that they only allow read access (i.e. you can only get information from a brokerage account, you can't make any changes like posting a trade) and the data only updates once a day (so if you make a trade, the information won't be reflected until the end of day). Plaid allows you to receive data on stocks, ETFs, crypto, and options.

### [SnapTrade](https://snaptrade.com/)

![SnapTrade](./assets/snaptrade.jpg)

Snaptrade focuses on retail brokerages and offers coverage from 22 companies
from Fidelity to Robinhood to Coinbase. Snaptrade allows read and write access
(i.e. you can make changes to an account like posting a trade in addition to
getting information like holdings data) and the data updates in near real time.
Snaptrade allows you to trade stocks, ETFs, crypto, and options.


### [Sophtron](https://sophtron.com/index)

![Shophtron](./assets/sophtron.png)

Sophtron allows you to connect to 14,000 financial institutions from banks to
credit card companies to brokerages to crypto exchanges and receive data. Like
Plaid, Sophtron only allows read access and not write access, so your users
won't be able to trade. Sophtron is able to offer the widest coverage of
financial institutions because they have a sophisticated AI engine that allows
them to parse new financial institutions websites and build new integrations
without involving a human 95% of the time.

### [Upvest](https://upvest.co/)

![Upvest](./assets/upvest.jpg)

Upvest is a licensed financial broker focused on the European market. While not
technically a universal brokerage integration API, Upvest has similar
functionality in that it allows you to offer trading and get information about a
user's portfolio without having to become a broker yourself. Upvest allows you
to trade stocks, ETFs, and crypto. The upside to using Upvest is that if a user
doesn't have an account, they can open one using Upvest but the downside is if
they have an account at another broker, they would have to move their account to
Upvest or open a new one.

Upvest also allows you to open up a savings plan for customers.


### [Lemon Markets](https://www.lemon.markets/)

![Lemon Markets](./assets/lemon-markets.png)

Lemon Markets is also a licensed financial broker focused on the European market
that allows you to offer account creation and trading and get information about
a user's portfolio. Lemon Markets allows you to trade stocks and ETFs and also
allows you to open up a savings plan for customers.

### [ETFmatic](https://etfmatic.com/)

![ETFmatic](./assets/etfmatic.png)

ETFmatic offers a white-label European robo-advisor API and widget. While
technically not a universal brokerage API, ETFmatic allows for a similar
functionality. ETFmatic also allows you to offer account creation and trading
and get information about a user's portfolio. As a robo-advisor, ETFmatic also
offers portfolio management services such as individualized portfolio
construction and rebalancing.

## Final Thoughts

If you're looking to introduce financial brokerage services into your app, then it's important to choose a provider that serves your needs. Some important things to consider are:

- What kind of institutional coverage do I need, both in terms of number of banks, brokerages, etc and types of institutions?
- What kind of functionality do I need? Do you need to just receive data or do you also want to trade? Do you want to allow users to create a new account or to connect an existing account?
- How often do I need my user's data to update?
- What geography do I want to operate in?
