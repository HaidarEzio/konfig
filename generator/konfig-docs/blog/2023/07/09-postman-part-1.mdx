Originally started as a side project, Postman has become one of the best tools
for collaboratively building APIs with over [1.29 billion requests created in
the past
year](https://www.postman.com/state-of-api/api-global-growth/#growing-ecosystem).


[As organizations' investments of time and resources into APIs
increase](https://www.postman.com/state-of-api/outlook-for-apis-and-more/#api-investments-to-climb),
API-first organizations must leverage testing tools like Postman. Adopting an
API tool is an effective way to save thousands of engineering hours.

{/* TRUNCATE */}

<Admonition type="note">
There are alternatives to Postman like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) and
[Paw](https://paw.cloud/) but [Postman is still the most widely used tool by a
long
margin](https://www.postman.com/state-of-api/tooling-for-apis-and-development/#api-platforms-and-tools).
</Admonition>

Today enterprises like [Salesforce and WhatsApp use Postman to document their
API](https://www.postman.com/state-of-api/api-global-growth/#most-popular-apis)
and engineers are using Postman to [run 2,700+ tests on 100's of APIs on every
deployment](https://www.postman.com/case-studies/youi/). At Konfig, we
frequently use Postman to test APIs and generate SDKs. So we created the
<Gradient>ultimate</Gradient> guide on using Postman to document and test your
API. In this 3-part guide, we will cover the fundamentals of Postman and dive
into techniques to effectively document and test your API.

- Part 1 (Fundamentals)
- <Tooltip tip="Coming soon!" text="Part 2 (Documentation & Testing)"/>
- <Tooltip tip="Coming soon!" text="Part 3 (Continuous Integration)"/>

By the end of this guide, you will be the official "Postman expert" on your team
ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

## Setup

Goes without being said but you should probably have the Postman app downloaded
[here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) so you can follow along. There is a
web client for Postman but we suggest downloading the desktop application
because it makes the application easily accessible and keeps you from burying
Postman in a sea of browser tabs.

### Example API [Optional]

If you don't have an API, you can locally run our example API implementation to
follow the guide yourself.

<details>
<summary>Setup Instructions for Example API</summary>
<div>
The [example API](https://github.com/konfig-dev/fastapi-example) is written in
Python using the [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) framework so we can
easily generate an [OpenAPI Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/).
It includes <Tooltip tip="Create, read, update, and delete" text="CRUD"/> operations on a fake User database.

<Admonition type="info" title="System Requirements">
    [Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and
    [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) are required to run the example
    API. Refer to the documentation for installation instructions on your
    system.
</Admonition>

To set up the example API run the following script.

```shell
# link[11:55] https://github.com/konfig-dev/fastapi-example
git clone https://github.com/konfig-dev/fastapi-example
cd fastapi-example
./start.sh
```

The example API has 5 operations.

1. `GET` List Users - returns a list of users
2. `GET` Get User - returns the details of a user by ID
3. `POST` Create User - inserts a user into the database
4. `PUT` Update User - updates a user in the database
5. `DELETE` Delete User - removes a user from the database
</div>

## Postman Fundamentals

Postman's functionality revolves around the concept of a
[Collection](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collections/collections-overview/).

According to Postman:

> Postman Collections are a group of saved requests. Every request you send in
> Postman appears under the History tab of the sidebar. On a small scale, reusing
> requests through the history section is convenient. As your Postman usage grows,
> it can be time-consuming to find a particular request in your history. Instead
> of scrolling through your history section, you can save all your requests as a
> group for easier access.

We feel this description doesn't do justice to Collections. Collections are more
than just a place to store saved requests and history. Collections enable
Postman to build all the powerful automation features we will cover in this
guide.

### Workspace

Collections live under a
[Workspace](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/managing-workspaces/).
A workspace is a place for your engineering team to collaborate. You can easily
manage granular permissions and organize all of your API work. Workspaces also
house other features such as
[Environments](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/managing-environments/)
and [API
definitions](https://learning.postman.com/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/the-api-workflow/)
like OpenAPI Specification or GraphQL.

To create a Workspace, follow the demonstration below.

### Collection

On the surface, a Collection is a group of saved HTTP requests that makes it
easy to navigate and locate example requests for a specific endpoint. But as you
will see in this guide, Collections are truly at the core of Postman's standout
feature set.

<Figure caption="Every feature stems from Collections">

</Figure>

#### Organization

Postman brings structure to the chaos of API development by prescribing a robust
organization model. By containing all the nitty gritty details of API requests
into neatly structured request templates, grokking an API becomes 10x easier.

<Figure src="/img/collections-organization.png" caption="Requests are neatly organized in the sidebar. Collections also allow you to group related requests into folders."/>

#### Collaboration

Collections make it easy to collaborate on API development and integration.
Collections can be shared publicly for third-party developers to integrate your
API or privately among your teammates to collaborate on internal API
development. Collections are also forkable and version controlled allowing
developers to simultaneously make changes while avoiding conflicts. Postman's
cloud-based architecture also implements permissioning and persistence of your
Collections.

<Figure src="/img/collection-collaboration.png" caption="Sharing a Postman Collection prompts a window to share with people in your organization, publicly for other developers to fork, or via API"/>

#### Testing

Collections can also be used for building test suites ranging from simple
assertions to multi-step request flows. By leveraging JavaScript to validate
responses and orchestrate multi-step requests, you can design advanced test
suites for your API. Postman Collections can also be integrated with Ci/CD
tooling to streamline testing and deployment with
[Newman](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman) and [Postman
API](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-public-workspace/documentation/12959542-c8142d51-e97c-46b6-bd77-52bb66712c9a).

<Figure src="/img/collection-testing.png" caption="The 'Tests' tab is where you
write scripts that are executed to design complex test suites"/>

#### Third-party Tooling

Postman Collections follow a standard JSON-based protocol so developers can
build third-party tools to enhance Postman's capabilities. You can either export
a Postman Collection directly through the UI or dynamically fetch it from the
Postman API. This allows tooling like SDK generators and CI/CD pipelines to be
tightly integrated with your Postman workflow.

<Figure caption="Example JSON of Exported Postman Collection">
<CH.Code rows={20}>
```json
// from ./assets/Requests.postman_collection.json
```
</CH.Code>
</Figure>



#### How to Create a Collection
To create a Collection, click the <PlusButton/> button in the top-left corner.

<VideoPlayer autoplay url="/video/create-collection.mov" />

### Variables

Collections can store dynamic values called a
[Variable](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/) that
can be used when constructing a Request.  Variables save a lot of time when you
have common values across multiple requests in your Collection. Try to always
use Variables to organize your values into one place and allow for easy
parameterization of your requests.

<Figure src="/img/salesforce-platform-apis-variables.png" caption={<span style={{fontSize: "13px"}}>The
most popular API in the world, Salesforce Platform APIs, has 17 variables
configured for convenience (<a
href="https://www.postman.com/state-of-api/api-global-growth/#most-popular-apis">source</a>)</span>}/>


#### Always Create a `baseUrl` Variable (Recommended <Flame/>)

We suggest that you always start with a Variable named `baseUrl`. Using a
single `baseUrl` variable allows you to quickly configure API environments (e.g.
development, staging, production, etc.) and shorten the URL in your requests.

<VideoSection>

1. [Go to "Variables" tab](seek)
1. [Create a variable named "baseUrl"](seek)
1. [Add a request](seek)
1. [Use the curly brace syntax](seek) to shorten the URL
1. [Click "Send"](seek)

<VideoPlayer playbackRate={1.2} autoplay url="/video/variables.mov"/>

</VideoSection>

<Admonition type="info" title="Variables in Variables">
    Sometimes you need to parameterize your `baseUrl` which is possible using
    the curly brace syntax inside of the Variable's value. For example, you
    might have domains based on a "provider" like `aws` or "region" like
    `us-east-1`.

    ![variables in variable](/img/variables-in-variable.png)

    It's not obvious that this works but it does. But it allows for more powerful
    variables when you need them.
</Admonition>

#### Curly Brace Syntax

You may have noticed that Postman provides a syntax for inserting variables
using curly braces. If you are familiar with templating engines like
[Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) or
[Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/), this syntax should feel familiar. You
can use the the curly brace syntax (e.g. `{{variable}}`) to insert a variable
**anywhere** in your Request.

For example in the URL.
![url variable](/img/url-variable.png)

Or as a path parameter.
![param variable](/img/param-variable.png)

#### What is "Initial value" vs. "Current value"?

You also may have noticed there is an "Initial value" and "Current value" column
under the "Variables" tab. This is a convenient feature from Postman that allows
you to save variable values for your teammates.

<Figure src="/img/initial-current-value.png" caption="Initial and Current Value Columns"/>

The "Initial value" is shared in your Workspace with collaborators while
"Current value" is kept local to your session.

- Use "Initial value" to store helpful examples (i.e. query example) or commonly
shared values (`baseUrl`)
- Edit the "Current value" for configuring temporary values

<VideoSection>

You can "reset" to set your current values to initial values. To reset all your
current values to initial values at once, [Click the `Reset all` button](seek)
on the right side. To reset a single variable, [Click the `Reset` button](seek).

<VideoPlayer autoplay url="/video/reset-variables.mov"/>

</VideoSection>

<VideoSection>

To persist your current values to initial values, [Click the `Persist all` button](seek)
on the right side. To persist a single variable, [Click the `Persist` button](seek).

<VideoPlayer autoplay url="/video/persist-variables.mov"/>

</VideoSection>


### Variable Scope

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph global [Global]
        subgraph environment [Environment]
            subgraph collection [Collection]
            end
        end
    end
```

Variables live in a
[Scope](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/#variable-scopes).
In the last section, we made a variable in the scope of a Collection. But
variables can also be added to `Global` and `Environment` scopes.

<VideoSection>

Scopes help define where a Variable is available to use.

1. [**Global** scope variables are available everywhere in your Workspace](seek)
1. [**Environment** scope variables are available when the environment is active](seek)
    1. [You can configure your Environment by selecting the menu in the top-right corner](seek)
1. [**Collection** scope variables are only available to a Collection](seek)

<Figure caption="Demonstration of creating Variables in different Scopes">
    <VideoPlayer playbackRate={1.4} autoplay url="/video/scope.mov"/>
</Figure>

</VideoSection>

Generally, you should organize authorization variables in the Environment Scope
and API-specific variables in the Collection Scope. The Global Scope is mainly
used in scripting.

<Figure caption="Rule of thumb on which scope to organize your Variables">
```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Variable --> IA{Is used in Authorization?}
    IA -->|Yes| E[Environment Scope]
    IA -->|No| C[Collection Scope]
```
</Figure>

### Authorization

You can configure Authorization by going to the "Authorization" tab. **We
strongly suggest putting authentication credentials in an Environment Scope so
your teammates can document authorization requirements and reuse the
authentication credentials.** Otherwise you will have to tediously add the
security credentials to the Variables of every Collection.

<Admonition type="note">
If you want to avoid persisting sensitive credentials, you can leave the
"Initial value" column blank. This way you always set the variable by
configuring the "Current value" column.

<Figure src="/img/salesforce-platform-apis-environment-variables.png" caption="Example empty Initial values in the Environment Variables Template for Salesforce Platform APIs"/>

</Admonition>

Here is a quick demonstration of configuring API key Authorization for a Collection.

<VideoSection>

1. [Go to the Collection's Authorization tab](seek)
1. [Configure the Authorization type](seek)
    1. In this case  we need to provide the `X-API-Key` header
1. [Create an Environment Variable for your credentials](seek)
1. [Set the Variable as `secret` so the value is masked on the screen](seek). Setting a variable to `secret` simply makes it masked in the UI.
1. [Ensure that your request is set to `Inherit auth from parent` (i.e. Collection)](seek)
1. [Click `Send` to test your credentials](seek)

<VideoPlayer autoplay url="/video/authorization.mov"/>

</VideoSection>

<Admonition type="info" title="Postman does not support your authentication scheme?">

If Postman does not natively support your [Authorization type](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/authorization/authorization-types/) then you can use
the ["Pre-request
Script"](https://learning.postman.com/docs/writing-scripts/pre-request-scripts/)
tab under your Collection to programmatically set Environment Variables.

For example, you can use the following script to add 3 header values from your
environment variables. Postman runs the Pre-request script for your Collection
before every Request so these headers will be conveniently applied for every
request.

![pre-request headers](/img/pre-request-headers.png)

<details>
<summary>Copy Code</summary>
```javascript
pm.request.addHeader({ key: "client_id", value: pm.environment.get("CLIENT_ID") })
pm.request.addHeader({ key: "client_secret", value: pm.environment.get("CLIENT_SECRET") })
pm.request.addHeader({ key: "module_secret", value: pm.environment.get("MODULE_SECRET") })
```
</details>

</Admonition>

Want to organize all your API work on your own? You are bound to define your API
testing work in code in ephemeral scripts that are bound to get lost in the
black hole of a codebase. Instead, we suggest you use Postman as it provides a
robust data model and intuitive UX to effectively organize your API work.

But Postman goes much further than just organizing your requests. Let's learn about helpful workflows and features for documentation
and testing in <Tooltip tip="Coming soon!" text="part 2"/>.
