      summary: Create an Asset Report
      operationId: assetReportCreate
      description: |-
        The `/asset_report/create` endpoint initiates the process of creating an Asset Report, which can then be retrieved by passing the `asset_report_token` return value to the `/asset_report/get` or `/asset_report/pdf/get` endpoints.
        The Asset Report takes some time to be created and is not available immediately after calling `/asset_report/create`. When the Asset Report is ready to be retrieved using `/asset_report/get` or `/asset_report/pdf/get`, Plaid will fire a `PRODUCT_READY` webhook. For full details of the webhook schema, see [Asset Report webhooks](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#webhooks).
        The `/asset_report/create` endpoint creates an Asset Report at a moment in time. Asset Reports are immutable. To get an updated Asset Report, use the `/asset_report/refresh` endpoint.
