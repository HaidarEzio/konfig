This post highlights opinions with heavy vulgar ðŸ˜³

</Admonition>

Ask any developer, do you prefer GraphQL or REST? It will likely spark an
opinionated conversation which can often devolve into vulgar opinions instead of
matter-of-facts. Developers often find themselves entangled in discussions about
the merits of each approach, but like any engineering decision, **there are no
one-size-fits-all solutions**. This post aims to dissect the coexistence of
GraphQL and REST, highlighting the practical tradeoffs that shape this dynamic
landscape.

To be "sciency", I reviewed thousands of discussions on YouTube, Reddit, Hacker
News, and Blog Posts. I then collected, categorized, and analyzed the top
discussions.  Here are my findings.

<Admonition type="note">
**For this post, I wanted to make 100% sure that the tone of this article
is neutral and unbiased. I am not trying to promote one over the other. At
Konfig, we use GraphQL in our internal APIs but also build on the REST-focused
OpenAPI and standards.**

## Briefly about GraphQL and REST

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) and
[REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) are two
different approaches to building APIs. GraphQL is a query language for APIs and
a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. REST is an
architectural style for building APIs. REST is not a standard, but rather a set
of constraints that define how the server and client should communicate. REST is
often implemented using HTTP.

To understand the GraphQL vs. REST debate, I went to the places where developers
like to discuss these sorts of topics: YouTube, Reddit, Twitter, and Hacker
News. I parsed thousands of discussions and organized my findings in this
article. I did my best to make sure only to curate thought-provoking
discussions.

I then took the discussions to a whiteboard, categorized them into "Pro GraphQL", "Pro REST", or "Neutral", and clustered them into perspectives. Each
section in this post will highlight a perspective along with the relevant
discussions. Finally, I chose to highlight blog posts from GitHub and Shopify
that serve as useful case studies in this debate.

## Neutral

To start, I think it's important to highlight the neutral discussions. In my
opinion, these are the ones that hold the most truth in that they acknowledge
the tradeoffs of each approach. They are also the rarest opinions to find since
most developers are stubborn in their ways.

### GraphQL is great for some use cases, but not all

<Admonition type="info" title="Key Takeaway">

GraphQL was [born out of the need to solve a specific problem at
Facebook](https://engineering.fb.com/2015/09/14/core-data/graphql-a-data-query-language/).
Specifically the migration from the web to mobile. GraphQL is great for highly
relational data models and large teams with enormous scaling problems. But it's
not a silver bullet.

### The benefits of GraphQL are great, but difficult to implement in practice

## Pro REST

### GraphQL can be amazing, but usually, it's not worth the complication

### GraphQL is not performant without a lot of investment in infrastructure

## Pro GraphQL

### GraphQL has an amazing developer experience

### The benefits of GraphQL only start to appear in the largest organizations

## The Takeaway?

In most cases, for GraphQL to be solving your problems, the number of developers
on your team and the traffic of your API should be unicorn scale. But unless you
are building a unicorn right now, you probably should not worry about that level
of scale because the complexity is not worth it. Take giants like Twilio and
Stripe, for example, they have yet to introduce GraphQL into their public APIs.
