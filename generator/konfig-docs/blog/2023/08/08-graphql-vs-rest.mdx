If you ask any developer, do you prefer GraphQL or REST? It will likely spark an
opinionated conversation which can often devolve into opinions instead of matter
of facts. Developers often find themselves entangled in discussions about
the merits of each approach, but like any engineering decision, there are no
one-size-fits-all solutions. This post aims to dissect the coexistence of
GraphQL and REST, highlighting the practical tradeoffs that shape this dynamic
landscape.

### Our Experience

At Konfig, we inherited the GraphQL architecture from RedwoodJS in our internal
code path from the frontend to the backend. In my time, I spent a month
researching GraphQL as a specification to build a company for. I had
conversations with Propel Data, Yuzu, and colleagues of mine who are proficient
in GraphQL. I have also built a [Mint](https://mint.intuit.com/) + Spreadsheet
[toy
application](https://github.com/dphuang2/finpad/blob/main/apps/backend/schema.graphql)
using GraphQL.
