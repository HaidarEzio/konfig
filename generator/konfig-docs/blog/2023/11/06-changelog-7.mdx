## Python SDK Refactor

We've refactored the Python SDK to return Pydantic-based response values which
allows for using the
[__getattr__](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getattr__).
This is slightly more concise than the previous version, which used the
[`__getitem__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getitem__)
syntax to access response values.

### Before

Previously, you had to use the `[]` syntax to access response values

```python
response = client.store.place_order(quantity=1000)
print(response.body["order_id"])
```

### After

With Pydantic-based response values, you can use the `.` syntax to access

```python
response = client.store.place_order(quantity=1000)
print(response.order_id)
```

Notice how there is also no need to use the `body` attribute to access the
response body. All new Python SDKs will be using this new syntax.

We will not be updating previously generated Python SDKs to use this new syntax
to ensure backwards compatibility.

## Non-SDK Snippets in API Portal

The API Reference page now generates non-SDK code snippets such as cURL or
languages that do not have an SDK. This allows you to quickly copy and paste
code snippets regardless of whether or not there is an SDK for your language.
