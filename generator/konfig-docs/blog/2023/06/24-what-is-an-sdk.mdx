<Tooltip tip="Software Development Kit">SDKs</Tooltip> makes the integration of <Tooltip
  tip="Just a fancy term for a server that responds to network requests in a particular way"
  text="REST APIs"
/> easier by packaging
<Tooltip
  tip="Code that is always necessary to integrate with an API."
  text="boilerplate"
/> code for developers.

### Why do developers need help integrating APIs?

Let's take a look at the numbers.

[Plaid](https://plaid.com) has a REST API with 215 <Tooltip
  text="operations"
  tip='An operation like "create user" or "delete user"'
/>, 1346 <Tooltip
  tip='A data model like a "User" table in a database'
  text="schemas"
/>, and 215 <Tooltip
  tip='A parameter like "id" for a "get user by id" operation'
  text="parameters"
/>.

[SnapTrade](https://snaptrade.com/) has a
REST API with 91 operations, 125 schemas, and 183 parameters.

[Twilio](https://twilio.com/) has a
REST API with 199 operations, 152 schemas, and 874 parameters.

The complexity of these APIs can be daunting for developers who are under a time
pressure to integrate an API and frustrating for API companies because
onboarding is time consuming. Developers are required to parse tons of
documentation and code while API companies must provide continuous support for a
successful partnership. To make matters worse, developers can be using a
programming language that nobody at the API company knows. **To alleviate the
pain, best-in-class API companies publish SDKs to accelerate the integration
process.**

## So how does an SDK actually help?

Lets walkthrough an example in Python integrating Twilio's API without an SDK.
Then we will rewrite our implementation using their SDK. Finally we will analyze
the significant difference between implementations.

For this example we send an SMS and retrieve the sent SMS by ID.

### Without an SDK

<CH.Scrollycoding>

Import your favorite request library to make HTTP requests. In this case we are
using Python's `requests` library. Then lets initialize all our parameters.


```python without-sdk.py focus=1,3:12
# from ./assets/without-sdk.py
```

---

Construct the target URL for our HTTP request. We found the URL from [Twilio's
documentation](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/api?code-sample=code-send-an-sms-using-the-programmable-sms-api&code-language=curl&code-sdk-version=json).

```python without-sdk.py focus=14:15
```

---

Construct our request body using the format from the [documentation](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/send-messages#send-an-sms-with-twilios-api).

```python without-sdk.py focus=18:22
```

---

Construct our authentication credentials according to how Twilio receives
credentials and [how the `requests` library performs basic
authentication](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/authentication/#basic-authentication)
which in this case is a tuple where the first item is the username and the
second item is the password.

```python without-sdk.py focus=24
```

----

Make a `POST` request using the `requests` library and cross our fingers ðŸ¤ž that
we got all the previous steps right with no typos.

```python without-sdk.py focus=25
```

---

Deserialize the response from JSON and retrieve the `sid` field as shown in an
example response from the documentation.

```python without-sdk.py focus=27
```

---

To retrieve the message we construct a URL based on the format described in the [documentation](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/api/message-resource#fetch-a-message-resource).

```python without-sdk.py focus=30
```

---

Make a `GET` request with the new URL while remembering to pass in the `auth`
variable we assigned earlier.

```python without-sdk.py focus=31
```


</CH.Scrollycoding>

Whew ðŸ˜ª we did it. It only took 7 trips back and forth from the documentation
but we finally did it. Now lets take a look at what its like to implement the
same flow with Twilio's SDK.

### With an SDK <Flame/>

<CH.Scrollycoding>

Take a final look at what it looks like to implement this flow without an SDK
because you'll never see it again.

```python with-sdk.py
# from ./assets/without-sdk.py
```

---

Replace the requests import with Twilio's Python SDK

```python with-sdk.py focus=1
from twilio.rest import Client

# Twilio account credentials
account_sid = 'YOUR_ACCOUNT_SID'
auth_token = 'YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN'

# Set the sender's and recipient's phone numbers
from_number = '+1234567890'  # Your Twilio phone number
to_number = '+9876543210'  # Destination phone number

# Set the message content
message = 'Hello from Twilio!'

# Twilio API endpoint
url = f'https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/{account_sid}/Messages.json'

# Step 1: Send SMS
send_data = {
    'From': from_number,
    'To': to_number,
    'Body': message
}

auth = (account_sid, auth_token)
send_response = requests.post(url, data=send_data, auth=auth)

sms_sid = send_response.json()['sid']

# Step 2: Retrieve SMS details
retrieve_url = f'{url}/{sms_sid}.json'
retrieve_response = requests.get(retrieve_url, auth=auth)

sms_data = retrieve_response.json()
```

---

Remove the URL and request body variables as the SDK handles this for us.

```python with-sdk.py
from twilio.rest import Client

# Twilio account credentials
account_sid = 'YOUR_ACCOUNT_SID'
auth_token = 'YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN'

# Set the sender's and recipient's phone numbers
from_number = '+1234567890'  # Your Twilio phone number
to_number = '+9876543210'  # Destination phone number

# Set the message content
message = 'Hello from Twilio!'

# Step 1: Send SMS
auth = (account_sid, auth_token)
send_response = requests.post(url, data=send_data, auth=auth)

sms_sid = send_response.json()['sid']

# Step 2: Retrieve SMS details
retrieve_url = f'{url}/{sms_sid}.json'
retrieve_response = requests.get(retrieve_url, auth=auth)

sms_data = retrieve_response.json()
```

---

Insantiate Twilio's client with credentials instead of creating a raw tuple for
our credentials. If we made a typo or forgot to pass our credentials the SDK
will let us know ahead of time.

```python with-sdk.py focus=15
from twilio.rest import Client

# Twilio account credentials
account_sid = 'YOUR_ACCOUNT_SID'
auth_token = 'YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN'

# Set the sender's and recipient's phone numbers
from_number = '+1234567890'  # Your Twilio phone number
to_number = '+9876543210'  # Destination phone number

# Set the message content
message = 'Hello from Twilio!'

# Step 1: Send SMS
client = Client(account_sid, auth_token)
send_response = requests.post(url, data=send_data, auth=auth)

sms_sid = send_response.json()['sid']

# Step 2: Retrieve SMS details
retrieve_url = f'{url}/{sms_sid}.json'
retrieve_response = requests.get(retrieve_url, auth=auth)

sms_data = retrieve_response.json()
```

----

Call `client.messages.create` and pass in the `from_`, `to`, and `body`
parameters. If we make a typo here the SDK will let us know ahead of time.

```python with-sdk.py focus=16:20
from twilio.rest import Client

# Twilio account credentials
account_sid = 'YOUR_ACCOUNT_SID'
auth_token = 'YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN'

# Set the sender's and recipient's phone numbers
from_number = '+1234567890'  # Your Twilio phone number
to_number = '+9876543210'  # Destination phone number

# Set the message content
message = 'Hello from Twilio!'

# Step 1: Send SMS
client = Client(account_sid, auth_token)
send_response = client.messages.create(
    from_=from_number,
    to=to_number,
    body=message
)

sms_sid = send_response.json()['sid']

# Step 2: Retrieve SMS details
retrieve_url = f'{url}/{sms_sid}.json'
retrieve_response = requests.get(retrieve_url, auth=auth)

sms_data = retrieve_response.json()
```

---

Retrieve the `sid` value from the response without calling _`.json()`_.

```python with-sdk.py focus=22
from twilio.rest import Client

# Twilio account credentials
account_sid = 'YOUR_ACCOUNT_SID'
auth_token = 'YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN'

# Set the sender's and recipient's phone numbers
from_number = '+1234567890'  # Your Twilio phone number
to_number = '+9876543210'  # Destination phone number

# Set the message content
message = 'Hello from Twilio!'

# Step 1: Send SMS
client = Client(account_sid, auth_token)
send_response = client.messages.create(
    from_=from_number,
    to=to_number,
    body=message
)

sms_sid = send_response.sid

# Step 2: Retrieve SMS details
retrieve_url = f'{url}/{sms_sid}.json'
retrieve_response = requests.get(retrieve_url, auth=auth)

sms_data = retrieve_response.json()
```

---

Replace our second request with a simple method call.

```python with-sdk.py focus=25
from twilio.rest import Client

# Twilio account credentials
account_sid = 'YOUR_ACCOUNT_SID'
auth_token = 'YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN'

# Set the sender's and recipient's phone numbers
from_number = '+1234567890'  # Your Twilio phone number
to_number = '+9876543210'  # Destination phone number

# Set the message content
message = 'Hello from Twilio!'

# Step 1: Send SMS
client = Client(account_sid, auth_token)
send_response = client.messages.create(
    from_=from_number,
    to=to_number,
    body=message
)

sms_sid = send_response.sid

# Step 2: Retrieve SMS details
sms = client.messages(sms_sid).fetch()
```

---

By using the SDK we reduced the lines of code by 24% and removed 31% of the variables ðŸŽ‰.

```python with-sdk.py
```

## SDK vs. no SDK

Lets breakdown through the significant differences that made the SDK code better.

### Setup

<CH.Section>
We do not need to [manually construct the URLs](focus://without-sdk.py#15,30) to make an HTTP request.

<CH.Code>
```python with-sdk.py focus=15
# from ./assets/with-sdk.py
```

```python without-sdk.py
# from ./assets/without-sdk.py
```
</CH.Code>
</CH.Section>

### Authentication

<CH.Section>

Credentials were stored once and stored as part of the SDK. Notice that [we did not need to pass in an `auth` variable again](focus://without-sdk.py#24,31[48:56]).

<CH.Code>
```python with-sdk.py focus=15,25
# from ./assets/with-sdk.py
```

```python without-sdk.py
# from ./assets/without-sdk.py
```
</CH.Code>
</CH.Section>

### Complexity

<CH.Section>

Making HTTP requests were converted to ergonomic method calls so we [deleted a
variable](focus://without-sdk.py#18:22), [removed any mention of `POST` and `GET`
requests](focus://without-sdk.py#25[26:29],31[30:32]), and [removed explicit
JSON deserialization](focus://without-sdk.py#27[25:30],33[30:36]). The SDK also
would have [easily caught incorrect argument names when calling `create()` and
`fetch()`](focus://with-sdk.py#17:19,25[23:30]).

<CH.Code>
```python with-sdk.py focus=16:20,25
# from ./assets/with-sdk.py
```

```python without-sdk.py
# from ./assets/without-sdk.py
```
</CH.Code>
</CH.Section>

## Conclusion

SDKs are effective in reducing the pain a developer feels when integrating a
REST API. SDKs throw out manual steps from setup/authentication, reduce the
cognitive load for the end developer, and reduce the lines of code.
Furthermore, SDKs catch compilation or runtime errors earlier in the development
process.
