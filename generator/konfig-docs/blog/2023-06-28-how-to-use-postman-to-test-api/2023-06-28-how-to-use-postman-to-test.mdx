Postman is one of the best tools for building APIs. It is amazing for quickly
executing HTTP requests but its also great for creating and automating tests for
your API. So we created the ultimate guide on how to use Postman to test your
API. In this guide we will cover four major patterns for testing your API.

1. One-off request
2. Multiple requests
3. Conditional requests
4. Postman in CI

<Admonition type="note">
For your convenience, we included a working [example API](#example-api-optional)
for testing.
</Admonition>

## Setup

### Postman

Download Postman app [here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

### Example API [Optional]

**Setting up the Example API is optional. You can follow this guide with your own API.**

This guide uses an example API written in Python using the
[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) framework so we can easily generate an
[<Tooltip tip="OpenAPI Specification" text="OAS"/>](https://swagger.io/specification/). The example API simulates
<Tooltip tip="Create, read, update, and delete" text="CRUD"/> operations on a
fake User database.

<Admonition type="info" title="System Requirements">
    [Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and
    [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) are required to run the example
    API. Refer to the documentation for installation instructions on your
    system.
</Admonition>

To download and starting the example API run the following script.

```shell
https://github.com/konfig-dev/fastapi-example
cd fastapi-example
./start.sh
```

The example API has 5 operations.

<CH.Section>
1. [`GET` List Users](focus://20:22) - returns a list of users
2. [`GET` Get User](focus://25:30) - returns the details of a user by ID
3. [`POST` Create User](focus://33:36) - inserts a user into the database
4. [`PUT` Update User](focus://39:45) - updates a user in the database
5. [`DELETE` Delete User](focus://48:54) - removes a user from the database

<CH.Code rows={8}>
```python main.py
# from ../../../../misc/fastapi-example/main.py
```
</CH.Code>
</CH.Section>

## Testing

The following sections describes different tips and workflows for testing your
API.

### Generate Collection from OAS ℹ️

We recommend generating your collections from an OAS to save time. If you don't
have an OAS, you can manually create the collection.

#### Generate From OpenAPI Specification (Recommended <Flame/>)

<VideoSection>

1. [Make sure the APIs element is visible on the sidebar](seek)
2. [Create an API and give it a name](seek)
3. [Import your OAS](seek)
4. [Generate a collection from your definition](seek)

### Single Request

Often times you will just want to execute a request to test one-off operations.
We suggest that you create a new collection for these one-off operations so they
are separated from collections used for tests.

### Multiple Requests

### Test Scripts

## Setup Postman and GitHub Actions
