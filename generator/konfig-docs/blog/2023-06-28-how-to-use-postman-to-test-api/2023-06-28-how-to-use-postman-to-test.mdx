Originally started off as a side project, Postman has become one of the best
tools for collaboratively building APIs and especially provides amazing
capabilities for testing. Today engineers are using Postman to [run 2,700+ tests
on 100's of APIs on every deploy](https://www.postman.com/case-studies/youi/).
So we created the <Gradient>ultimate</Gradient> guide on using postman to test
your API. In this guide we will cover workflows and features you must know to
effectively test your API. By the end of this guide you will be the official
"Postman expert" on your team ðŸ˜Ž.

 **Lets go!**

## Setup

Goes without being said but you should probably have the Postman app downloaded
[here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) so you can follow along.

### Example API [Optional]

If you don't have your own API, you can run our simple API implementation to
follow the guide yourselfâ€”your welcome.

<details>
<summary>Setup Instructions for Example API</summary>
<div>
The [example API](https://github.com/konfig-dev/fastapi-example) is
written in Python using the [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) framework
so we can easily generate an [<Tooltip tip="OpenAPI Specification"
text="OAS"/>](https://swagger.io/specification/). It includes
<Tooltip tip="Create, read, update, and delete" text="CRUD"/> operations on a
fake User database.

<Admonition type="info" title="System Requirements">
    [Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and
    [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) are required to run the example
    API. Refer to the documentation for installation instructions on your
    system.
</Admonition>

To setup the example API run the following script.

```shell
# link[11:55] https://github.com/konfig-dev/fastapi-example
git clone https://github.com/konfig-dev/fastapi-example
cd fastapi-example
./start.sh
```

The example API has 5 operations.

1. `GET` List Users - returns a list of users
2. `GET` Get User - returns the details of a user by ID
3. `POST` Create User - inserts a user into the database
4. `PUT` Update User - updates a user in the database
5. `DELETE` Delete User - removes a user from the database

## The Anatomy of Postman

Lets briefly overview how Postman is organized and go over the basics. Postman's data model revolves
around the concept of a
[Collection](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collections/collections-overview/).

According to Postman:

> Postman Collections are a group of saved requests. Every request you send in
> Postman appears under the History tab of the sidebar. On a small scale, reusing
> requests through the history section is convenient. As your Postman usage grows,
> it can be time-consuming to find a particular request in your history. Instead
> of scrolling through your history section, you can save all your requests as a
> group for easier access.

Collections live under a
[Workspace](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/managing-workspaces/)
or
[API](https://learning.postman.com/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/the-api-workflow/).
A Collection contains requests and a request contains a URL, path parameters,
query parameters, headers, request body, and method for an HTTP request.

### Workspace

At the highest level we have a Workspace where you can invite team members
and...do your work. Create your Workspace to get started.

<VideoSection>
1. [Create a Workspace](seek)
1. [Give it a name and summary and click "Create Workspace"](seek)
1. [Invite a team member](seek) [optional]
<VideoPlayer playbackRate={1.2} autoplay url="/video/workspace.mov" />
</VideoSection>



### Create a Collection

Collections are where all the real work gets done. Click the <PlusButton/>
button in the top-left corner to create a Collection.

<VideoPlayer autoplay url="/video/create-collection.mov" />

### Using Variables

Collections not only save your requests but also store dynamic values called a
[Variable](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/).

#### Create a `baseUrl` Variable (Recommended <Flame/>)

Lets create our first variable.

We suggest that you always start out with a Variable named `baseUrl`. Using a
single `baseUrl` variable allows you to quickly configure API environments (e.g.
staging, prod, etc.) and keep your requests <Tooltip tip="Don't Repeat Yourself"
text="DRY"/>.

<VideoSection>

1. [Go to "Variables" tab](seek)
1. [Create a variable named "baseUrl"](seek)
1. [Add a request](seek)
1. [Use the curly brace syntax](seek)
1. [Click "Send"](seek)

<VideoPlayer playbackRate={1.2} autoplay url="/video/variables.mov"/>

</VideoSection>

<Admonition type="info" title="Variables in Variables">
    Sometimes you need to parameterize your `baseUrl` which is possible using
    the curly brace syntax. For example you might have domains based on a
    "provider" like `aws` or "region" like `us-east-1`.

    ![variables in variable](/img/variables-in-variable.png)

    Its not obvious that this works but it does.
</Admonition>

#### What is "Initial value" vs. "Current value"?

You'll notice there is an "Initial value" and "Current value" column under the
"Variables" tab.

<Figure src="/img/initial-current-value.png" caption="Initial and Current Value"/>

The "Initial value" is shared in your Workspace with collaborators while
"Current value" is kept local to your session.

- Use "Initial value" to store helpful examples (i.e. query example) or commonly
shared values (`baseUrl`)
- Edit the "Current value" for configuring temporary values

<VideoSection>

To reset all your current values to initial values, [click the `Reset all` button](seek)
on the right side. [Click the `Reset` button](seek) to reset a single variable.

<VideoPlayer autoplay url="/video/reset-variables.mov"/>

</VideoSection>

<VideoSection>

To persist your current values to initial values, [click the `Persist all` button](seek)
on the right side. [Click the `Persist` button](seek) to persist a single variable.

<VideoPlayer autoplay url="/video/persist-variables.mov"/>

</VideoSection>

#### Curly Brace Syntax

Use the curly brace syntax (i.e. `{{variable}}`) to insert a variable
**anywhere** in your Request.

For example in the URL.
![url variable](/img/url-variable.png)

Or as a parameter.
![param variable](/img/param-variable.png)

Variables save a lot of time when you have common values amongst multiple
requests in your Collection. For example you can quickly change a User ID used
across multiple requests.

#### Scope

You should also know that Variables live in a [Scope](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/#variable-scopes).

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph global [Global]
        subgraph environment [Environment]
            subgraph collection [Collection]
            end
        end
    end
```

<VideoSection>

1. [**Global** scope variables are available everywhere in your Workspace](seek)
1. [**Environment** scope variables are available when the environment is active](seek)
    1. [You can configure your Environment by selecting the menu in the top-right corner](seek)
1. [**Collection** scope variables are only available to a Collection](seek)

<VideoPlayer playbackRate={1.4} autoplay url="/video/scope.mov"/>

</VideoSection>


### Authorization

If your API needs authorization you can configure it for your Collection by
going to the "Authorization" tab. We suggest putting authentication credentials
under an Environment so that others in your workspace can reuse it if necessary.
If you do not want to share credentials you can still create the variable under
a environment but leave "Initial value" blank.

Here is a quick demonstration of configuring Authentication for a Collection.

<VideoSection>

1. [Go to the Collection's Authorization tab](seek)
1. [Configure the Authorization type](seek)
    1. In this case  we need to provide the `X-API-Key` header
1. [Create an Environment Variable for your credentials](seek)
1. [Set the Variable as `secret` so the value is masked on the screen](seek)
1. [Ensure that your request is set to `Inherit auth from parent` (i.e. Collection)](seek)
1. [Click `Send` to test your credentials](seek)

<VideoPlayer autoplay url="/video/authorization.mov"/>

</VideoSection>

<Admonition type="info" title="Custom Authorization">

#### Pre-request Script

If Postman does not natively support your Authorization type then you can use
the ["Pre-request
Script"](https://learning.postman.com/docs/writing-scripts/pre-request-scripts/)
tab to programatically set Environment Variables.

For example you can use the following script to add 3 header values from your
environment variables before any request in your Collection.

![pre-request headers](/img/pre-request-headers.png)

<details>
<summary>Copy Code</summary>
```javascript
pm.request.addHeader({ key: "client_id", value: pm.environment.get("CLIENT_ID") })
pm.request.addHeader({ key: "client_secret", value: pm.environment.get("CLIENT_SECRET") })
pm.request.addHeader({ key: "module_secret", value: pm.environment.get("MODULE_SECRET") })
```
</details>

## Testing

Now that we know the basics lets jump into workflows and features for testing.

### Single Request

Often times you will just want to execute a request to test one-off operations.
We suggest that you organize one-off requests into its own collection so they
are separated from collections used for tests (as you'll see in later sections).

#### Generate Collection from OAS (Recommended<Flame/>)

Generating your collections from an OAS can save a lot of time to bootstrap your
Collection of one-off requests. Postman will automatically create a `baseUrl`
variable and setup Authentication based on your OAS. It will also bootstrap
requests for every request based on the
[schemas](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0#schema-object) in your OAS.

<VideoSection>

1. [Make sure the APIs element is visible on the sidebar](seek) by configuring your sidebar
1. [Create an API and give it a name](seek)
1. [Import your OAS](seek)
    1. If you are using our example API then import `openapi.json` from the repository
1. [Generate a collection from your definition](seek)

<VideoPlayer playbackRate={1.2} autoplay url="/video/generate-collection.mov"/>

</VideoSection>

<Admonition type="note">
The generated Collection will live in the "APIs" tab under your OAS definition.
This is slightly confusing as it won't be visible under the "Collections" tab
but it does help keep your Collections organized by API.

If you want you can copy the Collection from your API tab to the Collections tab
by clicking the <DotsButton/> button next to your Collection.
<VideoPlayer playbackRate={1.2} autoplay url="/video/copy-to-collections.mov"/>
</Admonition>

If you don't have an OAS then you can always manually create a Collection and
add requests to it.

<Admonition type="info" title="Tip">
#### Console (Helpful<Flame/>)

<VideoSection>

Open the console at the bottom of the window to inspect your requests. This is
especially helpful for debugging <Tooltip tip="Using scripts to dynamically set
parameters" text="programmatic"/> or many requests.

<VideoPlayer autoplay url="/video/console.mov"/>

### Sequential Requests

Postman is amazing for one-off requests but its also amazing for running
multiple requests at once. Postman makes it extremely simple by organizing
sequential requests into a Collection.

#### Request Execution Order

#### Test Scripts

##### `pm.globals.set`

##### `postman.setNextRequest`

##### Looping Requests

#### Advanced

##### Idempotency

##### Random Data
