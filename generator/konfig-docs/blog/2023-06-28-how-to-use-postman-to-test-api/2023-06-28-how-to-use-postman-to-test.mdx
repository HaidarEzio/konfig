Postman is one of the best tools for building APIs. It is widely known as an
easy way to make HTTP requests but its also a great way to create and automate
tests for your API. But the documentation and tutorials online are disparate and
not cohesive. So we created the most comprehensive guide on how to test your API
using Postman. In this guide we will cover four major patterns for testing your API.

1. Single request
2. Multiple requests
3. Conditional requests
4. Postman in CI

We will also include an example API for your to run yourself as a toy example
throughout the guide.

## Setup

### Postman

Download Postman app [here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

### Example API (Optional)

<Admonition type="note" title="Optional">
    Setting up the Example API is optional. You can follow this guide with your own API.
</Admonition>

This guide uses an example API written in Python using the
[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) framework. We are simulating an API
that manages a user database with <Tooltip tip="Create, read, update, and
delete" text="CRUD"/> operations.

<Admonition type="info" title="System Requirements">
    [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) are required to run the example API
</Admonition>

To download the code and start the API run the following script.

```shell
https://github.com/konfig-dev/fastapi-example
cd fastapi-example
./start.sh
```

The example API has 5 operations.

<CH.Section>
1. [`GET` List Users](focus://20:22) - returns a list of users
2. [`GET` Get User](focus://25:30) - returns the details of a user by ID
3. [`POST` Create User](focus://33:36) - inserts a user into the database
4. [`PUT` Update User](focus://39:45) - updates a user in the database
5. [`DELETE` Delete User](focus://48:54) - removes a user from the database

<CH.Code rows={8}>
```python main.py
# from ../../../../misc/fastapi-example/main.py
```
</CH.Code>
</CH.Section>

## Testing

The following sections describe different patterns for testing your API.

### Create a Collection

To get started, create a
[Collection](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collections/collections-overview/#:~:text=Postman%20Collections%20are%20a%20group,particular%20request%20in%20your%20history.)
in Postman to store our requests and tests. You can either manually create your
collection or generate one from an [OpenAPI
Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/).

#### Manual

To manually create a Collection click the <img src={createCollectionButton}
height="15rem"/> in the top-left corner and give your collection a name.

<VideoPlayer url="/video/create-collection.mov"/>

#### Generate From OpenAPI Specification

### Single Request

Often times you will just want to execute a request to test one operation. Postman makes this extremely easy

### Multiple Requests

### Test Scripts

## Setup Postman and GitHub Actions
