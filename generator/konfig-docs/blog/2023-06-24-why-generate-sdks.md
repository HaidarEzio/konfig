# Why Generate SDKs?

For more complex APIs with a larger number of endpoints, more complex data models, and more advanced functionality, an SDK can be very helpful. An SDK can provide a higher-level abstraction on top of the API, making it easier for developers to use the API in their applications.

## Key Benefits

Here are some of the key benefits of providing an SDK for an API:

1. Simplified API interactions: An SDK can provide a higher-level interface for interacting with the API, making it easier for developers to understand and use the API in their applications. This can reduce the amount of code that developers need to write and can make it easier to handle errors and exceptions.

2. Consistent code: An SDK can provide a consistent way of interacting with the API, ensuring that developers are using best practices and reducing the risk of errors and inconsistencies in the code.

3. Improved developer experience: An SDK can provide documentation, code examples, and other resources to help developers get started with the API more quickly and easily.

4. Cross-platform compatibility: An SDK can provide support for multiple programming languages and platforms, making it easier for developers to use the API in their preferred programming environment.

## Other Benefits

Besides the key benefits, SDKs enable certain features that are hard to implement otherwise.

1. Clear error messages: The SDK should provide clear and informative error messages that help developers quickly understand what went wrong and how to resolve the issue.

2. Automatic retries: The SDK could automatically retry requests that fail due to temporary issues, such as network connectivity problems or API downtime.

3. Caching: The SDK could cache successful API responses, which can help reduce the number of requests made to the API and improve application performance.

4. Error analytics: The SDK could provide analytics on the most common errors that developers encounter, which can help API-first companies identify issues with their APIs and improve their overall reliability.

## Why Generate?

Generating SDKs is a **better** way to offer SDKs for your API as it offers two crucial advantages over hand-writing them.

1. Speed: Generating an SDK is faster than hand-writing it. With Konfig, you can generate code in seconds or minutes, rather than taking days or weeks to write the same code manually.

2. Accuracy: Generating an SDK ensures that the code is accurate and free of errors. This is especially important when dealing with complex APIs that have many endpoints and data types.
