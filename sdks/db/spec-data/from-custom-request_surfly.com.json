  "apiDescription": "By using the REST API, you can integrate our Co-browsing technology into  your own application or build a thin layer around our technology. You can  completely customize Surfly and automate the management of client and agent creation through the REST API.\n\nThe Surfly REST API allows you to integrate the functionality of our dashboard in a programmatic manner. With our API you can do the following things:\n* **Agents** - Manage your agents\n* **Sessions** - Get an overview of all your sessions\n* **Screenshots** - Create screenshots of your co-browsing sessions\n* **Clients** - Create new clients *(reseller only)*\n* **Servers** - Get a list of all available Surfly public cloud servers\n* **History** - Get an overview of sessions history\n* **Webhooks** - Manage your webhooks\n\nBelow you can find detailed code examples illustrating how to make the REST calls. You will need your REST API key (which can be found in the integration panel, just below the widget code).\n\n> The rate limit for making REST API calls is 100 req/min/IP address",
