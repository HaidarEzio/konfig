      "description": "Protected requests expect the `Authorization` header with a bearer token respecting the format `Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN`.\n\nThis **documentation is interactive**: set your `access_token` here and test all requests directly from your browser\n(`access_token` must be formatted as `Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN`).\nOr set it individually for each request, in the `Authorization` header.\n\n\n### Introduction\nThe API requires an `access_token` for every request (except [/ping](https://storage.googleapis.com)).\n\nStep-by-step:\n1. [Ask Ducky](mailto:api@ducky.eco) for a `CLIENT_ID` and a `CLIENT_SECRET`\n2. Negotiate an `access_token` with Auth0\n3. Send authenticated requests to Ducky API\n\nKeep reading to learn how to obtain an `access_token` and use it to perform requests.\n\n---\n\n### Prerequisite\nTo use the API, you have to get `CLIENT_ID` and a `CLIENT_SECRET`.\nTo do so, please contact Ducky at [api@ducky.eco](mailto:api@ducky.eco).\n\n> Note: even without an `access_token`, you can browse the documentation and explore its possibilities by looking at the example outputs.\n\n\n### Getting an access token\n#### Request\nAuthentication is provided by Auth0. Before using Ducky API, you send a query to Auth0, asking for an `access_token`.\n\nTo negotiate an `access_token`, send a request based on this curl snippet (update it with your `$CLIENT_ID`& `$CLIENT_SECRET`):\n\n```shell\ncurl --request POST \\\n  --url https://ducky-prod.eu.auth0.com/oauth/token \\\n  --header 'content-type: application/json' \\\n  --data '{\"client_id\":\"$CLIENT_ID\",\"client_secret\":\"$CLIENT_SECRET\",\"audience\":\"ducky-api-prod\",\"grant_type\":\"client_credentials\"}'\n```\n\n#### Response\nThe response contains an `access_token` and an expiration time. You should store both and use the `access_token` until its expiration date. After expiration, repeat the process above to negotiate a new token.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"access_token\": \"example_access_token\",\n  \"token_type\": \"Bearer\",\n  \"expires_in\": 86400\n}\n```\n```\n\n### Usage\nNow that you have an `access_token`, you can start using the Ducky API.\nSend the `access_token` with each request, in an `Authorization` header.\nMake sure to prefix it with the `token_type` which is always `Bearer`.\n\n##### Example\nTo make sure you're ready to use the API, you can use the [/ping/protected endpoint](https://storage.googleapis.com).\nIt validates your `access_token` and checks if the API is ready to accept connections.\n\n```shell\ncurl --request GET \\\n  --url https://api.ducky.eco/v3/ping/protected \\\n  --header 'authorization: Bearer example_access_token'\n```\n",

  "apiDescription": "Ducky Data's APIs provide footprint data for a wide variety of products and circular services, as well as individuals, and consumption-based emissions for municipalities and other administrative units.\n\nThe endpoints are divided by functionality. \nThe Calculate endpoints compute the footprint of an individual based on their habits and other lifestyle data. \nThe Change endpoint generates climate friendly tips based on the user's habits, and can be used to nudge the user towards sutainable behavioral change.\nThe Compare endpoints return the average footprint of a citizen in a given area (municipality or BSU).\nThe Convert endpoints turn physical data like energy use or transaction amount into climate footprint.\nReporting endpoints are for calculating scope 1 & 2 emissions according to the GHG protocol.\nThe Track endpoints returns the values of indicators (drivers of footprint) for a given area (municipality or BSU).\nThe Translate endpoints contextualize a given quantity of CO2e by expressing them in something more tangible, like a flight trip.\n\nIn the description of each endpoint, you will find the link to a user documentation page detailing the sources and calculation principles.\nAll of our user documentation pages can be found [here](https://support.ducky.eco/en/ducky-insights#introduction-to-ducky-insights).\n\n### Base URL\nThe API is served over HTTPS.\nThe section [API Servers](https://storage.googleapis.com) indicates the base URLs for all requests in the documentation.\n\n### Authentication\nThe API requires [authentication](https://storage.googleapis.com). You have to negotiate an `access_token` and send it with every request, in the `authorization` header.\n\nStep-by-step:\n1. [Email Ducky to request](mailto:api@ducky.eco) a `CLIENT_ID` and a `CLIENT_SECRET`\n2. Negotiate an `access_token` with Auth0\n3. Send authenticated requests to Ducky API\n\nLearn in detail how to negotiate and use an `access_token` in the [Authentication section](https://storage.googleapis.com).\n",
