  "apiDescription": "Open Api Specifications available at [https://github.com/factorialco/oas](https://github.com/factorialco/oasLooking)\n\nGuides and support available at [https://help.factorialhr.com/integrations](https://help.factorialhr.com/integrations)\n\n# Authentication\n\nThe public API provides two methods of authentication, ApiKeys and OAuth2. The following sections provide information regarding each one and their intent.\n\n## OAuth2\n\n> OAuth2 is used to identify individual users, not applications or platforms.\n\nOAuth2 is available for authenticating to the public API and making requests via third parties **on behalf of a user**. All actions are authored on behalf of the user that creates the token. This means the intent is to be used mainly to do submit actions the actual user is performing on an alternative interface.\n\nTo generate a token you will require opening an authorization dialog that returns a code, this code can then be exchanged for a token.\n\n### Configuration\n\nIn order to create an OAuth application, you must be an admin, head over to your [personal repository of OAuth applications](https://api.factorialhr.com/oauth/applications), click on `New application` and follow the creation process.\n\nThe Factorial API enforces the same permissions at the user level than the Factorial web application. This means that Factorial API users will only be able to perform the same actions they are allowed to do in the Factorial platform.\n\nNext step will be to generate the Authorization Code you will need in order to generate an OAuth2 Token.\n\n### OAuth2 Code Generation\n\nShould be generated via browser by opening the following url. The user should be already logged in to Factorial beforehand.\n\n`https://api.factorialhr.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=&redirect_uri=&response_type=code&scope=`\n\nYOUR_CLIENT_ID: OAuth2 Application Id\nREDIRECT_URI: OAuth2 Redirect URL\n\n#### State Parameter\n\nAn optional query parameter called `state` can be added to the code generation url. Any string can be used and will be sent on the callback url.\n\n> Authorization protocols provide a `state` parameter that allows you to restore the previous state of your application. The `state` parameter preserves some state objects set by the client in the Authorization request and makes it available to the client in the response.\n\n### OAuth2 Token Generation\n\nOnce you have the authorization code, you can request their access token to Factorial.\n\n`curl -X POST 'https://api.factorialhr.com/oauth/token' -d 'client_id=&client_secret=&code=&grant_type=authorization_code&redirect_uri='`\n\nYOUR_CLIENT_ID: OAuth2 Application Id\nYOUR_CLIENT_SECRET: OAuth2 Application Secret\nAUTHORIZATION_CODE: OAuth2 CODE\nREDIRECT_URI: OAuth2 Redirect URL\n\n> You can generate only one OAuth2 token per Code, that means that if you want to generate a new token for a Code that already have one you should refresh your token.\n\nEvery time a new token is generated a refresh token is generated as well, so that you can use it on the OAuth2 Refresh Token, and an expire date is also provided.\n\n### OAuth2 Refresh Token\n\nYou can generate a new token under the same Code with a new expire date (you can do it as many times as you need). A refresh token is also returned here so that you can use it on the OAuth2 Refresh Token again.\n\n`curl -X POST 'https://api.factorialhr.com/oauth/token' -d 'client_id=&client_secret=&refresh_token=&grant_type=refresh_token'`\n\nYOUR_CLIENT_ID: OAuth2 Application Id\nYOUR_CLIENT_SECRET: OAuth2 Application Secret\nREFRESH_TOKEN: OAuth2 Refresh Token\n\n### OAuth2 Revoke Token\n\nYou can revoke an access/refresh token if you do not want it to be active anylonger. This can happen in cases where you have refreshed your token and would like to revoke the previous token if you haven't used the new token yet, as using the new token automatically revokes the previous one.\n\n`curl -X POST 'https://api.factorialhr.com/oauth/revoke' -d 'client_id=&client_secret=&token='`\n\nYOUR_CLIENT_ID: OAuth2 Application Id\nYOUR_CLIENT_SECRET: OAuth2 Application Secret\nTOKEN: OAuth2 Access/Refresh Token (whichever you wish to revoke)\n\n### OAuth2 Token Usage\n\nThe generated token is the credential for performing authenticated requests to Factorial. This token should be included in the Authorization header prefixed with the word Bearer and a separating space.\nAs an example, if your token is `12345` then the header content should be `Bearer 12345`.\n\n### Maintaining a persistent connection\n\nTo maintain a persistent connection, you should not let the token expire. You can avoid this by simply refreshing your token before the expiration date. This will give you another token with a new expiration date, before that token expires you should refresh it again, and so on...\nIf you want to do this automatically, you should provide something in your code that will help you perform the update every time the token expires. Otherwise, you would have to do the update manually and make sure you refresh your token before the expiration date to maintain the connection.\n\n## ApiKeys\n\n> API keys are used to identify systems, not the individual users that access.\n\nApiKeys have **TOTAL ACCESS** to everything and never expire. Its the creators responsibility to generate them and store them securely.\n\n### Generation\n\nIn the `Core>Keys` section of this documentation you can access the apis for managing this resource.\n\n### Usage\n\nApiKeys are a single string of symbols that must be added as a custom header on the request. The header name must be `x-api-key` and the key must be the value without any prefixes.\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nApiKey management require full admin permissions as the resource itself allows for full admin access to the entire platform on behalf of the company and not of a user, therefore any operations are not linked to any user in particular.\n\n# Development\n\n## SDKs\n\nComing soon\n\n## Sandbox\n\nA sandbox/demo environment is available for testing integrations via public API calls. Developers can request provisioning with full access to a demo company where to test code before actually interacting with a production environment.\n\nContact your account manager or account executive to request this environment and get OAuth2 credentials for generating tokens.\n\nNote: the domain for sandbox is different than that from production. Sandbox base domain is `http://api.demo.factorialhr.com`\n\n## Postman\n\nClick the \"Run in Postman\" button to open the full list of endpoints on your Postman workspace as a Postman Collection.\nInside the collection lookout for the Collection's Variables, configure your variables accordingly.\n\n### Delegating Token Generation To Postman\n\nComing soon\n\n# Changelog\n\nComing soon\n\n# How to...\n\n## Custom Fields\n\nCustom fields are useful when you want to add some fields that are not the default ones, to every employee of the company.\n\nFor that, you have to create via Factorial App the base custom field in order to have all the employees with it. That option is available in customization, inside the company menu\n\nOnce you have that, via API, you can [Create a value for a custom field](https://apidoc.factorialhr.com/#72f3f786-e37d-4e80-ada2-0beedd03b171) to each employee. You should know the custom field id in order to make that, you can check it by [getting a collection of custom fields](https://apidoc.factorialhr.com/#f98dae5a-a8d0-474e-a181-7e9603409b42)",
