  Adatree's Accredited Data Recipient (ADR) Platform Open Banking API
  definition. API payloads conform to the Consumer Data Right Data Standard
  1.5.1.

  Payloads are sample payloads to represent the types of data to which the CDR
  regime gives access. Adatree's simplified API makes it easier for you to
  access the CDR ecosystem, while maintaining the high security standards
  implemented by the regime. It also keeps the data in the original, open
  source, CDR format to avoid lock-in to a proprietary format.
