  Use the Invoicing API to create, send, and manage invoices. You can also use
  the API or webhooks to track invoice payments. When you send an invoice to a
  customer, the invoice moves from draft to payable state. PayPal then emails
  the customer a link to the invoice on the PayPal website. Customers with a
  PayPal account can log in and pay the invoice with PayPal. Alternatively,
  customers can pay as a guest with a debit card or credit card. For more
  information, see the <a href="/docs/invoicing/">Invoicing Overview</a> and the
  <a href="/docs/invoicing/basic-integration/">Invoicing Integration Guide</a>.
