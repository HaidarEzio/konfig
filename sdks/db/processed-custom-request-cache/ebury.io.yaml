  apiDescription: |
    Ebury API allows customers:
      to retrieve accounts, balances, beneficiaries, and transactions;
      to get buy/sell estimates and quotes, book trades and retrieve trade history;
      to allocate payments to a trade and beneficiary, and to submit payments in bulk;
      to download documents such as trade receipt, payment instruction and payment receipt;
      to manage the authorised persons on their account.
    The Metadata API allows applications to clarify some parts of the Ebury API
      that are impractical to express schematically.
