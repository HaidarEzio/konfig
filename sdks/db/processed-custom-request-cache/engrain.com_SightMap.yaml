    # Introduction


    The SightMap® API uses standard HTTP verbs to communicate and HTTP status

    codes to indicate status and errors. All responses come in standard JSON.

    The SightMap API is served over HTTPS to ensure data privacy; HTTP is not

    supported.


    # Versioning


    Versions are communicated as `VERSION.RELEASE-DATE`, where `VERSION` denotes

    the version number of the API and prefixed to all API request paths, such as

    `/v1/assets`. `RELEASE-DATE` denotes backwards-compatible changes to the

    API.


    When any non-backwards compatible additions must be made to the API, the

    version number will be incremented.


    ## Backwards-compatible changes


    We consider the following changes to be backwards-compatible:


    - Adding new API resources.

    - Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods.

    - Adding new properties to existing API responses.

    - Changing the order of properties in existing API responses.

    - Changing the length or format of object IDs or other opaque strings.

    - You can safely assume object IDs we generate will never exceed 255
      characters, but you should be able to handle IDs of up to that length. If
      for example you’re using MySQL, you should store IDs in a `VARCHAR(255)
      COLLATE utf8_bin` column (the `COLLATE` configuration ensures
      case-sensitivity in lookups).

    # Authentication


    For requests which require Authentication, an API Key can be provided by

    either the `api-key` query parameter or `API-Key` header. We recommend the

    header over the query parameter as it avoids your API key from being stored

    in browser history and most server logs. If neither query parameter or

    header is provided, a `401` status code is returned with the following JSON:


    ```

    {
      "message": "No API key found in request"
    }

    ```


    If your API key cannot be validated, a `403` status code is returned with

    the following JSON:


    ```

    {
      "message": "Invalid authentication credentials"
    }

    ```

    # Experimental features


    We provide new API features via experimental flags. This allows users to
    opt-in

    for new functionality and provide feedback prior to a feature becoming
    generally

    available (GA). We believe in stability without stagnation. This ability
    allows

    our team to build and ship best-in-class APIs faster while upholding

    backwards-compatibility on GA features.


    Experimental features are subject to change while undergoing development and

    feedback. Therefore, they are exempt from any backwards-compatibility
    guarantees

    until they reach GA. We do not expect nor recommend using experimental
    features

    in production environments unless a partnership has been established with
    our

    teams working closely together.


    Flags are provided via the `Experimental-Flags` header. A comma-separated
    list

    is expected in order to pass multiple flags on a single request.


    ```

    curl -i https://api.sightmap.com/v1/assets \
      -H "API-Key: 12345" \
      -H "Experimental-Flags: flag-1,flag-2"
    ```


    # Errors


    The SightMap API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or

    failure of the API request. The body of the response will be JSON in the

    following format:


    ```

    {
      "message": "Not found"
    }
