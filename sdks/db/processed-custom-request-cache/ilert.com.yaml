  apiDescription: >-

    The ilert API is a
    [RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) API
    and provides programmatic access to entities in ilert and lets you easily
    integrate ilert with 3rd party tools. If you are looking to develop an
    inbound integration (e.g. for a monitoring tool), please use our [Events
    API](https://api.ilert.com). 


    The API supports the JSON content type for requests and responses. The
    response content type is requested via the HTTP Accept header
    (`application/json`). All resources are accessible via https and are located
    at `api.ilert.com/api`. 

    ## Authentication

    The REST API accepts bearer API tokens. Each user may create API keys using
    the ilert web application. Note: Make sure to send the `Bearer ` prefix e.g.
    `Bearer APIKEY` when sending api key requests. By default, access to all
    resources (using any method) requires the client to be authenticated.


    ## Team Context
     When using API tokens, the currently selected team context of the user will not be taken into account, i.e. list results will always return all entities to which the user has a view permission. When using basic auth credentials the currently selected team context of the user will be used to filter resource results. The context may be overwritten for API key calls using the `team-context` HTTP header. Specifying `0` for ALL teams, `-1` for MY teams or a specific team id e.g. `team-context=901` to fetch results for a certain team.  

    ## Errors

    ilert uses HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of an API
    request. Codes in the 2xx range indicate success, codes in the 4xx range
    indicate a client error (e.g. a missing required parameter) and codes in the
    5xx range indicate an error with ilert's servers. In case of an error, the
    response body contains the following information:

     Attribute     | Description 
     ------------- | ------------- 
     status  | the corresponsing HTTP status code  
     message  | a human readable description of the error 
     code  | error code, used to identify error type
