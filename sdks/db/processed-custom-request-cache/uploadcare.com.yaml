    ### Summary

    Upload API provides several ways of uploading files to Uploadcare servers in
    a

    secure and reliable way.


    ### API endpoints

    Upload API's root is located at `https://upload.uploadcare.com/`.

    **Note**: All API endpoints end with a forward slash `/`. Please do not
    forget to include it.


    ### API clients

    Please checkout [API clients](https://uploadcare.com/docs/integrations/)
    page for a

    list of official and third party Upload API clients.


    ### File storage

    Every uploaded file is **temporary** by nature and subject to be deleted
    within a

    24-hour period. **Mark the file as stored** to make it permanent:

    * On upload via the [`UPLOADCARE_STORE`
    flag](https://uploadcare.com/api-refs/upload-api/)

    * [Store](https://uploadcare.com/api-refs/upload-api/) or
      [copy](https://uploadcare.com/api-refs/upload-api/) an already uploaded
      file via [REST API](https://uploadcare.com/api-refs/upload-api/).

    **Note**: `UPLOADCARE_STORE=auto` parameter delegates the choice of the

    file storing behavior to a project

    [auto-store](https://app.uploadcare.com/projects/-/settings/#storage)

    setting (which is enabled by default). 


    ### File delivery

    Once uploaded, your files become available via our
    [CDN](https://uploadcare.com/docs/delivery/).

    The CDN includes on the fly image processing features and can work as a
    proxy.
