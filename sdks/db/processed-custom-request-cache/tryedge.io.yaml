  apiDescription: "Edge Payment Technologies offers payment solutions for merchants in diverse legal industries. To learn more about Edge's proposition see our [about](https://tryedge.io/about) page.\n\nBefore starting with the API, you must [create a merchant account](https://dashboard.tryedge.io/merchant_accounts/new) and obtain API keys from the [Developer tab](https://dashboard.tryedge.io/developers) in your account dashboard. You will use the “Publishable key” with Edge JavaScript SDK and the “Secret key” on your website.\n\nThe Edge API is based upon REST principles, returns JSON responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes. We speficially use the [JSON:API](https://jsonapi.org/) specification.\n\nIf you're wanting to use Edge Payment Technologies in the browser to make a charge you're going to need to include the Edge javascript SDK. The\_Edge JavaScript SDK is a toolkit for encrypting data in the browser. Using the Edge JavaScript SDK means your customer's data never leaves their browser unencrypted. Include this in your HTML:\n\n``` html\n<script\n  src=\"https://assets.tryedge.io/assets/edge-028df78616a38778a73b92faac46bd2d5b1d4f3734f2902cc7d8548a0b7ffa4d.js\"\n  type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n```\n\nThen after that you need to initialize the client:\n\n``` javascript\nconst edge = new Edge('<Publishable Key>');\n\nedge.initializeForm().then(function (form) {\n  // Form configuration\n});\n```\n"
