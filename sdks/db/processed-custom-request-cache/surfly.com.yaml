  apiDescription: >-
    By using the REST API, you can integrate our Co-browsing technology into 
    your own application or build a thin layer around our technology. You can 
    completely customize Surfly and automate the management of client and agent
    creation through the REST API.


    The Surfly REST API allows you to integrate the functionality of our
    dashboard in a programmatic manner. With our API you can do the following
    things:

    * **Agents** - Manage your agents

    * **Sessions** - Get an overview of all your sessions

    * **Screenshots** - Create screenshots of your co-browsing sessions

    * **Clients** - Create new clients *(reseller only)*

    * **Servers** - Get a list of all available Surfly public cloud servers

    * **History** - Get an overview of sessions history

    * **Webhooks** - Manage your webhooks


    Below you can find detailed code examples illustrating how to make the REST
    calls. You will need your REST API key (which can be found in the
    integration panel, just below the widget code).


    > The rate limit for making REST API calls is 100 req/min/IP address
