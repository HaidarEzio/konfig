    You can use Spotify's Web API to discover music and podcasts, manage your
    Spotify library, control audio playback, and much more. Browse our available
    Web API endpoints using the sidebar at left, or via the navigation bar on
    top of this page on smaller screens.


    In order to make successful Web API requests your app will need a valid
    access token. One can be obtained through <a
    href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/">OAuth
    2.0</a>.


    The base URI for all Web API requests is `https://api.spotify.com/v1`.
