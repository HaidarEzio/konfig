        To authenticate yourself to ShipEngine, you need to include an `API-Key`
        header in each API call. If you don't include a key when making an API
        request, or if you use an incorrect or expired key, then ShipEngine will
        respond with a `401 Unauthorized` error.


        Learn more about API keys in our [authentication
        guide](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/auth/).

  apiDescription: >
    ShipEngine's easy-to-use REST API lets you manage all of your shipping needs
    without worrying about the complexities of different carrier APIs and
    protocols. We handle all the heavy lifting so you can focus on providing a
    first-class shipping experience for your customers at the best possible
    prices.


    Each of ShipEngine's features can be used by itself or in conjunction with
    each other to build powerful shipping functionality into your application or
    service.


    ## Getting Started

    If you're new to REST APIs then be sure to read our [introduction to
    REST](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/rest/) to understand the basics. 
    Learn how to [authenticate yourself to
    ShipEngine](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/auth/), and then use our
    [sandbox environment](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/sandbox/) to kick the
    tires and get familiar with our API. If you run into any problems, then be
    sure to check the [error handling
    guide](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/errors/) for tips.


    Here are some step-by-step **tutorials** to get you started:

      - [Learn how to create your first shipping label](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/labels/create-a-label/)
      - [Calculate shipping costs and compare rates across carriers](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/rates/)
      - [Track packages on-demand or in real time](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/tracking/)
      - [Validate mailing addresses anywhere on Earth](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/addresses/validation/)


    ## Shipping Labels for Every Major Carrier

    ShipEngine makes it easy to [create shipping labels for any
    carrier](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/labels/create-a-label/) and
    [download them](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/labels/downloading/) in a
    [variety of file formats](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/labels/formats/).
    You can even customize labels with your own
    [messages](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/labels/messages/) and
    [images](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/labels/branding/).



    ## Real-Time Package Tracking

    With ShipEngine you can [get the current status of a
    package](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/tracking/) or [subscribe to
    real-time tracking
    updates](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/tracking/webhooks/) via webhooks.
    You can also create [custimized tracking
    pages](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/tracking/branded-tracking-page/) with
    your own branding so your customers will always know where their package is.



    ## Compare Shipping Costs Across Carriers

    Make sure you ship as cost-effectively as possible by [comparing rates
    across carriers](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/rates/get-shipment-rates/)
    using the ShipEngine Rates API. Or if you don't know the full shipment
    details yet, then you can [get rate
    estimates](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/rates/estimate/) with limited
    address info.



    ## Worldwide Address Validation

    ShipEngine supports [address
    validation](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/addresses/validation/) for
    virtually [every country on
    Earth](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/addresses/validation/countries/),
    including the United States, Canada, Great Britain, Australia, Germany,
    France, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Israel, Italy, and over 160 others.
