        You must authenticate your requests by including your API key in each
        request header as described below.


        Requests should include a header named `Authorization`, with the value
        `App {MY_API_KEY}`. Note the single space in the header value.


        Example: `Authorization: App MY_API_KEY`

        key](https://developer.leaflink.com/brands/api/getting-started/)


        **Legacy API keys:** If you are not using an Application API key, your
        authorization header should include the string `Token` and access will
        be scoped to all companies under which the user exists as a
        companystaff.


        Example: `Authorization: Token MY_API_KEY`
      in: header
      name: Authorization
      type: apiKey
