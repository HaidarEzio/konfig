    Adatree's Accredited Data Recipient (ADR) Platform Open Banking API
    definition. API payloads conform to the Consumer Data Right Data Standard
    1.5.1.

    Payloads are sample payloads to represent the types of data to which the CDR
    regime gives access. Adatree's simplified API makes it easier for you to
    access the CDR ecosystem, while maintaining the high security standards
    implemented by the regime. It also keeps the data in the original, open
    source, CDR format to avoid lock-in to a proprietary format.
