    API PRIMARY BASE URL


    https://app.bl.ink/api/v4


    Note: Enterprise customers must use the admin panel domain in place of
    https://app.bl.ink.

    Please use SSL (https) for all requests.

    All API calls are subject to a rate limit of 5 connections per second per IP
    address. All requests exceeding that limitation will receive an HTTP 533,
    HTTP 544, or HTTP 503 (Service Temporarily Unavailable).

    # Authentication

    All endpoints require a valid access token for authentication:

    1. Invoke the ```POST /access_token``` endpoint to get a new access_token

    1. Add the following header to all endpoint requests:
     ```Authorization: Bearer <access_token>```
    If you see a refresh token in your BL.INK UI, use that to get a new
    access_token


    There are two types of tokens, access and refresh token. An access token is
    used with each api call to verify the user. A user requests an access token
    with either their username and password, or their username and their refresh
    token. An access token expires after 24 hours. Our api end point to retrieve
    an access token will always return a valid access token so the user doesn't
    need to keep track of expiration.


    If you would rather not supply your password to receive an access token, you
    may use the refresh token instead..
