  apiDescription: >-
    This service is intended for live traffic, it is scoped for notification
    systems. It works synchronously (the answer of each message will contain the
    termination answer, and the message ID), but it may receive several requests
    simultaneously. Telintel LTD provides an HTTP API to send and receive SMS.
    It requires an application capable of reading JSON objects, GET/POST
    request, Authentication credentials (login and password that can be obtained
    through your Telintel sales manager) and enough credit to complete the
    procedure.

    Please note: the IP address where the requests will be sent must be
    reported, as the account will bind with that IP address. If a delivery
    receipt (DLR) is required for each SMS submission (where applicable) or a
    short code or long number has been purchased and the receipt of each inbound
    mobile originated (MO) message is desired, then a CallBack URL must be setup
    with the Telintel Support team.
