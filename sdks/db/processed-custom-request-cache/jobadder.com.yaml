  apiDescription: "# Getting Started\r\n\r\n## Authentication\r\n\r\nJobAdder uses the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow to issue API access tokens on behalf of users.\r\n\r\nAt a high-level, this flow has the following steps:\r\n\r\n- Your application directs the browser to the JobAdder authorization page.\r\n- The user authenticates and approves your application's request.\r\n- The user is redirected back to your application with an authorization code in the query string.\r\n- Your application sends this code to JobAdder to exchange for an API access token and optionally a refresh token.\r\n- Your application can now use these tokens to call the JobAdder API on behalf of the user.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n### 1. Redirect to the JobAdder authorization URL.\r\n\r\nYour application should redirect the user to the authorization URL\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttps://id.jobadder.com/connect/authorize\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following query parameters should be passed with the GET request:\r\n\r\n| parameter     | description                                                                       |\r\n|:--------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| response_type | **code** (required)                                                               |\r\n| client_id     | issued when you created your application (required)                               |\r\n| scope         | permissions to request, see [Scopes](https://api.jobadder.com) (required)  |\r\n| redirect_uri  | URL to redirect back to (required)                                                | \r\n| state         | unique string to be passed back (optional)                                        |\r\n\r\nThe **scope** parameter is a space-separated list of OAuth scopes indicating the desired access.\r\nSee [Scopes](https://api.jobadder.com) for the complete list of scopes.\r\n\r\nThe **redirect_uri** parameter must match one of the URLs specified when the client_id was issued.\r\n\r\nThe **state** parameter can be provided to carry through server-specific state. For example, you can use\r\nthis to help prevent forgery attacks.\r\n\r\nThe user will be presented with a login screen, and then a confirmation screen where they will grant your\r\napplication access to their JobAdder data.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n### 2. Receive an authorization code from JobAdder.\r\n\r\nAfter a successful login, the authorization server will redirect to the URL specified in step 1 passing \r\nthe following parameters passed with the GET request:\r\n\r\n| parameter     | description                           |\r\n|:--------------|:--------------------------------------|\r\n| code          | a temporary authorization code        | \r\n| state         | the unique string specified in step 1 |\r\n\r\nIf you passed a **state** parameter in step 1 then at this point you should compare the state parameter\r\nfrom this request with the state parameter from the request in step 1. If the states don't match then\r\nthe request may have been created by an unknown third party and you should abort the process.\r\n\r\nIf your request for access is denied by the user then the user will be redirected to the URL specified in step 1\r\nwith the following query parameters passed with the GET request:\r\n\r\n| parameter     | value         |\r\n|:--------------|:--------------|\r\n| error         | access_denied | \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n### 3. Exchange the authorization code for an access token.\r\n\r\nThe authorization code received in step 2 will remain valid for 5 minutes and should be exchanged for an \r\naccess token. To do this, submit a POST request to the token URL:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttps://id.jobadder.com/connect/token\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following  parameters should be included in the POST request:\r\n\r\n| parameter     | description                                                     |\r\n|:--------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| client_id     | issued when you created your application (required)             |\r\n| client_secret | issued when you created your application (required)             |\r\n| grant_type    | **authorization_code** (required)                               |\r\n| code          | the temporary authorization code received in step 2 (required)  |\r\n| redirect_uri  | the URL specified in step 1 (required)                          |\r\n\r\nThis request will return a JSON response containing the access token, for example\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  access_token: \"31ff7431b4c1dde02e386122702f5460\",\r\n  expires_in: 3600,\r\n  token_type: \"Bearer\",\r\n  refresh_token: \"e7672885d6da2db1e56d200dd292c801\",\r\n  api: \"https://api.jobadder.com/v2\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n| parameter     | description                                                                           |\r\n|:--------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| access_token  | token to be used as the Bearer token in the Authorization header of all API requests  |\r\n| expires_in    | expiration time of the access token in seconds since the response was generated       |\r\n| refresh_token | token to be used to request new access tokens                                         |\r\n| api           | The base URL to use for API access                                                    |\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n### 4. Exchange a refresh token for an access token.\r\n\r\nThe access token has a limited lifetime (currently 60 minutes). \r\nIf your application requested the **offline_access** scope (in step 1) then it is possible to gain \r\nextended access to the user's data by requesting a new access token using the refresh token.\r\nTo do this, submit a POST request to the token URL:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttps://id.jobadder.com/connect/token\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following  parameters should be included in the POST request:\r\n\r\n| parameter     | description                                         |\r\n|:--------------|:----------------------------------------------------|\r\n| client_id     | issued when you created your application (required) |\r\n| client_secret | issued when you created your application (required) |\r\n| grant_type    | **refresh_token** (required)                        |\r\n| refresh_token | the refresh token returned in step 3                |\r\n\r\nThis request will return a JSON response containing a new access token and request token.\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  access_token: \"d2534958b2d3b9e3b0e16c98f91f0184\",\r\n  expires_in: 3600,\r\n  token_type: \"Bearer\",\r\n  refresh_token: \"e1b495fa69c9bdacbc7e5dd535d4564f\",\r\n  api: \"https://api.jobadder.com/v2\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n## Scopes\r\n\r\nScopes allow you to clearly specify the type of information your application will access and the level of access it will need.\r\n\r\nIt's a good idea to limit the scopes that you request to the bare minimum so that users will feel confident with your application when granting access to their data.\r\n\r\n\r\n| scope | description |\r\n|:------|:------------|\r\n| **read** | View JobAdder data |\r\n| **write** | Manage

order of webhook notifications are not guaranteed, and idempotency may lead to duplicate notifications.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n## Notification messages\r\n\r\nWhen an event occurs, JobAdder will issue an HTTP POST to the URL you specified on your webhook.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"apiVersion\": 2,\r\n  \"event\": \"placement_approved\",\r\n  \"eventId\": \"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\",\r\n  \"eventDate\": \"2019-01-01T09:00:00Z\",\r\n  \"eventUser\": {},\r\n  \"eventData\": {},\r\n  <event details>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n## Events\r\n\r\nAll events require the **offline_access** scope, along with the scopes relevant to the event.\r\n\r\n| event name                      | required scopes
