        When you sign up for an account, you are given your first API key. To do
        so please [follow this link.](https://app.nanonets.com/#keys)


        Also you can generate additional API keys, and delete API keys (as you
        may need to rotate your keys in the future). NanoNets expects for the
        API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header
        that looks like the following:


        <span style="color:red">Authorization: REPLACE_API_KEY</span>


        All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP
        will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.

  apiDescription: >
    Welcome to the NanoNets API! You can use our API to build custom deep
    learning models.<br/>

    We have language bindings in Shell, Ruby, Golang, Java, C# and Python. You
    can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the
    programming language for the examples with the tabs in the top right. <br/>
    In the documentation, you will find ready to fire code samples in these
    languages as well as detailed API specs for different
    endpoints.<br/><br/><br/>
