    ## Introduction


    Welcome to the 30K Milefy API documentation!


    #### What does the Milefy API do?


    You can use it to:

    1. Calculate **mileage earnings** for specific flights,

    2. Learn which flights are eligible for **upgrades to a higher cabin**, e.g.
    from Economy to Business,

    3. Get a list of all **status benefits** that apply for each flight based on
    the travelers’s frequent flyer program status tier.

    4. Get a full list of **fare attributes** including seat selection, checked
    baggage, changeability and others.

    5. Track traveler frequent flyer accounts.


    Milefy API is a REST service using HTTPS protocol and JSON format to encode
    both request and response data.


    #### Request headers


    To enforce proper request encoding and its compression you should always set
    following headers:


    ##### Data format

    We use JSON format enchanced with <a
    href="http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html" target="_blank"
    title="Learn more about HAL and hypermedia">HAL hypermedia type</a>.


    Header: ```Accept: application/hal+json```


    ##### Character encoding


    Header: ```Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8```


    ##### API version


    Since version 2.5, we require the setting of an additional request header,
    which indicates which version of Milefy API you want to use. In case header
    is absent, version 2.4 will be used by default (not recommended).


    Header: ```X-Api-Version: v3.0```


    ## Performance


    #### Large flight result sets


    When working with large flight result sets processed by [Calculate
    attributes & benefits](http://milefy-api-docs.30k.com) method, it’s
    recommended to **divide them into smaller batches and send them in
    simultaneous requests**. When received, the multiple responses should then
    be remerged into a single result set. For example, instead of sending a
    single request containing a result set of 1,000 different flights, you can
    send 5 smaller requests simultaneously, each consisting of 200 flights.


    All divided requests for the same result set are billed as only one request.
    In order to assure that, you only need to fulfill the following two
    conditions:


    1. All requests need to be send almost at the same time (we need to receive
    them within a frame of less than 30 seconds),

    2. The flights need to be split into chunks of 50-200 flights.
