      platform which can be hosted in either the US or EU. Both versions are
      SOC2 certified, GDPR-ready, and HIPAA compliant.


      We started PostHog during YCombinator's W20 cohort and had the most
      successful B2B software launch on Hacker News since 2012 - with a product
      that was just 4 weeks old.


      With over 50k users, we're default alive, growing 97% through word of
      mouth, and we are in the top 0.01% most popular repos on GitHub.

    metaDescription: >-
      ShipEngine is the leading multi-carrier shipping API. Our highly efficient
      API helps brands, platforms and third-party logistics providers drive
      efficiency and cost savings through a network of 70-plus carriers
      worldwide. You can invest significant resources into building carrier and
      order source integrations. And, after those integrations are built, you
      can continue exhausting resources to maintain them. Many businesses choose
      this expensive, time-intensive path — only to realize the approach is
      unsustainable.


      There's a better alternative: Integrate once with ShipEngine and never
      worry about building or maintaining integrations again. Spend your team's
      valuable time and money on projects that are core to growing your
      business, rather than dealing with legacy carrier integrations. In
      addition to the ROI you achieve after implementing ShipEngine, our
      shipping API also offers pre-negotiated, discounted rates through the
      USPS, UPS and DHL. Our users report that shipping-related tasks that once
      took minutes now take seconds, and that ShipEngine's features and
      capabilities help unlock thousands in savings.


      Getting started with ShipEngine is easy.

      At Unstructured, we're on a mission to give organizations access to all of

      memos, to quarterly filings and plans of action, documents are the unit of
      information that companies depend on. And yet, 80% of this information is
      trapped in inaccessible formats, and businesses have long struggled to
      unlock this data, leading to information silos, inefficient
      decision-making, and repetitive work. Until now.


      Unstructured captures this unstructured data wherever it lives and
      transforms it into AI-friendly JSON files for companies who are eager to
      fold AI into their business.

      It all began with the frustration of using software that sucks. Prior to
      starting Keka, our core team was a 100 person business that needed an easy
      to use software for managing employees. We looked everywhere and all we
      found were software that was lousy and hard to use. We felt SME businesses
      in India deserved something better. Something awesome actually!


      Thus emerged Keka!

      There is no other CRM that provides sales reps and sales management with
      so many ways to view and analyze sales data, while delivering intelligent,
      system-generated insights.

      Plus, thanks to our automation engine and easy integration with other
      systems (such as email, ERP, marketing), Pipeliner eliminates many of the
      manual and routine tasks that other systems impose on both sales reps and
      sales managers.

      The Pipeliner CRM experience is so different from traditional CRM, which
      is why we drive the highest adoption rates, lower total cost of ownership,
      and rapid return on investment. Plus, with our quick onboarding and ease
      of learning to use and/or administer the system, there is little to no
      business disruption during deployment.

      And because we are committed to supporting the professional development of
      salespeople, we have even integrated our online sales magazine Sales POP!
      into the product to provide unparalleled sales-related content at the
      point of impact.

      Gladly is the only customer service software built around people, not
      tickets.


      AI is revolutionizing how we work and communicate. Consumer expectations
      of how they're known and treated by brands has never been greater. At the
      same time brands are under pressure to do more with less and must balance
      the tension between saving money with AI and automation, while still
      delivering world-class experiences for consumers. The right experiences
      create connection, loyalty and customer lifetime value.


      Customer service software built on tickets fails to navigate this tension.
      And brands who rely on ticketing software are failing in this new economy.
      Bloated tech stacks. Duplicate tickets. Consumer repetition and
      frustration. Fumbling and flustered agents. Two bad service experiences
      will lose a customer for life.


      Gladly applies AI differently, to help commerce brands deliver radically
      personal, concierge-level customer service at scale. With Gladly,
      consumers help themselves when they want and customer service agents are
      made into superheroes, gaining efficiency and productivity. Every
      conversation in Gladly starts with a real-time understanding of the
      customer -- who they are, their preferences, their conversation and
      purchase history with the brand, every interaction in one place. And with
      every channel built-in natively - VOICE, email, SMS, chat, social
      messaging, self-service – brands have one, lifelong conversation stream
      with their customers.


      Gladly's customers are the world's most loved brands -- Allbirds, Bombas,
      Crate & Barrel, Deckers, Eddie Bauer, FTD, Nordstrom, REI, Ulta Beauty,
      and Warby Parker. These brands and hundreds more leverage Gladly to build
      lifelong loyal customers through deep connections.


      Make customer service your business with Gladly.

      Loyalty programs once worked miracles for customer engagement.


      But with a dizzying range of disjointed loyalty schemes from countless
      brands, the majority of customers now rarely earn enough points with any
      one brand to put them to good use.


      So, at the start of 2015, our team set out to create a new global loyalty
      ecosystem.


      We're helping customers and brands alike discover the elusive customer
      loyalty that had become lost among less frequent customers.


      We are accelerating the customer's journey to rewards by making it easier
      for them to earn and spend points with a wider range of brands.


      Brands, meanwhile, benefit from the insights of a larger network, and the
      tools needed to enable better experiences for their most loyal customers.


      And, more importantly, our partners can discover those less frequent
      customers who - with the right incentives - can become loyal advocates.

      One product.🤳 17 years. 📆 250+ employees. 🧑‍💻Over 150,000 users.
      💥There's so much to say about it all. But here's the version that fits
      the character limit.


      We're FreeAgent. 👋 We make award-winning accounting software and provide
      superstar support for small businesses and their accountants and
      bookkeepers. We're a friendly bunch with a single goal bringing us all
      together: making users happier and more successful by putting them in
      control of their finances.


      But how did we get here? 🤔 You might remember 2007 as the year the first
      iPhone, Kindle and Fitbit debuted. It was also the year FreeAgent was
      launched.💡 Founders Ed, Olly and Roan had all been working as freelance
      designers or developers for a while. They created FreeAgent out of the
      frustration that doing the books was just too damn difficult for most of
      us. So they put their heads together and decided that there must be a
      better way to deal with their mounting piles of invoices, spreadsheets and
      receipts.


      Since our first hire back in 2008, we've also worked hard to make
      FreeAgent a ✨great✨ place to work.  We've grown to over 250 employees and
      we continue to build a diverse, high-performing, happy and collaborative
      team.


      In early 2018,  the company was acquired by the NatWest Group. Our growth
      has been given a turbo boost, yet we remain operationally independent of
      the group. 🚀


      Today, FreeAgent helps over 150,000 users take care of their finances -
      from the daily admin to big-picture planning - and do it all happily and
      successfully. Just like Ed, Olly and Roan set out to do all those years
      ago. 💙

      A few years back, Eric (Co-Founder and CEO) got a frustrated call from his
      dad. His dad's tire shop had plenty of happy customers, but only a handful
      of angry ones were leaving reviews. So we built a product that made
      getting more reviews as easy as sending a text.


      Launching in 2014, we set out to solve the same problem for local
      businesses everywhere, but we realized that messaging with customers
      wasn't just the better way to get reviews—it's the better way to do
      business. We've since built a multi-product platform that's modernizing
      the way local business gets done.


      We are here to provide local businesses with everything they need to win.
      Get more reviews, collect payments, send text marketing campaigns, and
      centralize your communications—all from one easy-to-use platform.

    metaDescription: >-
      We provide an algorithm REST API for companies in the last mile delivery
      space to dispatch drivers and optimize delivery sequences. Our customers
      range from traditional logistics companies with fleet management platforms
      to on-demand delivery companies with mobile apps and drivers. Clients can
      easily integrate our algorithm into their existing system to find optimal
      delivery plans. We are also planning to develop on-prem solutions so
      customers could deploy and host locally for flexibility and data security.


      What's different about LogisticsOS?


      There are many route optimization products in the market but there are
      three major flaws with them: They tend to make drivers traveling around
      the city, take hours to compute a result, and their solutions do not scale
      well with increasing volume.


      We think customers deserve something better. So, we have built a
      generation leap route optimization engine that solves the above problems
      by,


      Producing solutions with high route density. Drivers are now able to stay
      in one area.


      Producing consistent results and scales linearly with increasing volume.


      Significantly reduced computation time, I.e., hours to minutes, and
      minutes to seconds.


      Further reduce the total travel time by another 10%-20%, which results in
      direct savings for delivery companies.
